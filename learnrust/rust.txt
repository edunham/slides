Starting Rust
-------------

Why yet another language?

Why do they put guard rails around tourist attractions?

Coding has become a tourist attraction. 

contrast the days when only expert outdoorspeople could visit certain
attractions, vs now. 

Guard rails are bad when they keep the pros from doing their thing (in code,
this ties into the concept of zero-cost abstraction, and the availability of
unsafe. we'll talk about unsafe later)

Other starting points
---------------------

Talks are about showing you what questions to ask. Let me prime you with a
bunch of credible sources so you'll recognize them later: 

* internals.r-l.o
* users.r-l.o
* The Book
* Blogs (subteam members' especially)
* IRC
* stackoverflow/reddit (with caveats)

The Trinity of Rust-ish-ness
----------------------------

* Ownership
* Borrowing
* Lifetimes
