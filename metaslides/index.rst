about edunham's slides
======================

Slides?
-------

They're made with Sphinx and Hieroglyph.

Some of them are also made with a horrible pile of reveal.js and Pandoc.

Speaker notes?
--------------

When you're viewing a slide deck, hit ctrl+c to bring up the presenter console

.. note:: 

    see? here's a note to the speaker! It's in a ..note:: block in the source.

Feedback?
---------

If you've seen one of my talks in person or online and have an opinion about
it, please let me know! Email slides.edunham.net@edunham.net or IRC edunham on
freenode.net with your thoughts. 

I'm especially interested in suggestions for improving the abstracts and
organization of each presentation, since I often reuse the same slides a few
times.

Where are the slides from $CONFERENCE?
--------------------------------------

Try http://talks.edunham.net/ . Click on the conference name for the slides I
used at it.

Are the talks recorded?
-----------------------

When recordings are available, they're linked from the snapshot of the slides
from that conference.

Will you speak about $TOPIC?
----------------------------

Maybe! Email me (slides.edunham.net@edunham.net) or ping me (edunham on
irc.freenode.net) with your request!

Will you speak at $EVENT?
-------------------------

Probably! If access to the event is restricted based on something about the
attendees (where they work, how they look, etc), we'll need to discuss
appropriate compensation. However, I often donate talks to events which make
them available to everyone!
