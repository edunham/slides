Thinking about Software Development
===================================

* Changing files
  * Some changes manual, other changes automatic
  * Changes for different reasons
    * Add feature, fix bug, test idea
    * Sometimes have several reasons at once, want changes separate

Thinking about snapshots
========================

* Represented as changes to a file plus pointers to unchanged files

How Git sees your project
=========================

Unstaged | Staged | Committed

Goals of Distributed Version Control
====================================

* Reliability
* No SPOF
* Eliminate network dependencies

How?
