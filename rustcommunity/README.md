# sliderust

sliderust is a barebones HTML slide deck library.  Its main distinguishing feature is that the slides will work in [Servo](https://github.com/servo/servo) today.<sup>‡</sup>

Check out the [live demo!](http://kmcallister.github.io/sliderust/)  Use the left and right arrow keys to navigate.

`slides.md` contains the example slides in Markdown format.  The script `build.sh` will convert them to HTML using `rustdoc`.

‡ In theory. Servo is a work-in-progress and may do anything it likes up to and including eating your laundry.
