Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents
segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. Behind the scenes, Rust is also a
community that nurtures new contributors, consistently enforces its code of
conduct, and maintains a high-quality codebase.

This talk will discuss the implementation details, as well as the social
motivations and effects, of the customized infrastructure and workflow
practices which allow the small core team to have such a significant impact.
Come learn about bots which integrate with GitHub to identify and assist new
contributors, the "Not Rocket Science" process for holding a project's code to
high standards without being mean to anyone, and more!


Learn about the bots: 

    * Monotone -> Bors -> Homu
    * Highfive
    * Playbot / Playpen
    * Buildbot community slaves ("PRs welcome")

What's Rust? 

What's Community? 
What makes a community "healthy"? 


What's Automation? 

Two types of automation: *tools*, anything that takes an input and gives an
output. *memes*, cultural values/ideas that're propagated through the
community. One could argue that desire to cooperate with a tool is one of the
memes.
