<!--
CoC is 1/3 common-sense guidelines and 2/3 a clear and specific explanation of
how the mod team enforces them.

It has diversity-promoting side effects, but perhaps the most important policy
is "Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum". It's gently but thoroughly
enforced by our amazing mod team.

I think that training people to behave civilly and constructively in official
Rust spaces helps decrease the amount of someone's-being-a-jerk drama. Having
a clear escalation path also all but eliminates the generalized anger that
people start expressing when they feel both wronged and helpless.

The process of moderation cannot and should not be left to a computer, but we
can use technology to make our mods' work as easy as possible - make humans do
the things that require a human, but let the bots do the rest.

<!--
The first step to getting someone to follow a rule is to make them aware that
it exists. The CoC link is plastered all over all the official forums, and
Discourse (our mailing list alterntive) makes you click a "yes I'm being
constructive" button for your first 3 posts.

This way, claiming that you weren't aware we had a CoC makes you look so
foolish that nobody with much vanity would try it, thus saving our mods from
having to manually educate everyone.

# Excluding people?!

<!-
Enforcing community guidelines and demanding that everyone pay attention to
them might not sound like a filter, but that's how diversity works.

By having Automacon in English and in Portland, we've silently filtered out
everyone who doesn't speak our language or can't afford to travel here.

It's often tough to see who the first barrier to entry in a community has
filtered out, because by definition they aren't there.... But AC on slashdot
here is an example of someone whom our CoC policies exclude.

RFCs.

Well, at least mandatory if you want to get a large change in. When we try to
automatically maintain a repository of code that always passes all the tests,
it helps to have asked "how will we test this code?" before merging stuff.

And I think it's less painful to get criticism in the early stages of
developing an idea, rather than after you've invested hours of your life in an
implementation.

Unusual in that he tests the result of merging, then fast-forwards the tree.
Triggered by an r+, a human's "I think we should merge this" review. There are
features for this with Jenkins tests in Gerritt.

This has the added benefit that keeping the tests up to date and fast is now
everybody's problem, because it'll slow down your workflow if you don't.

This is a culture change and is easier to enstate at a project's inception
than once its testing practices have solidified.

I believe this is necessary for any code that people work on. If the code is
fully and perfectly correct, why are you changing it? If not, you need a test
suite to prevent regressions.

This is essential if you're working on public code, and can be extremely

multitasking with several other things.

of the repo the commit touches is useful!
