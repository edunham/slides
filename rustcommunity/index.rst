Rust

    :align: right

What?

* Safe
* Concurrent
* Fast

How?

* Ownership
* Borrowing
* Lifetimes

.. note:: 

    Out of these requirements fall zero-cost abstraction, a type system
    that makes Haskellers happy, etc

Automation
----------

.. note::

Life Is Better
==============


.. note::

    The Rust community isn't free of problems, but there are some issues that
    I've seen show up pretty consistently in other places where I've been
    involved, which Rust seems to lack. I've had a unique opportunity to pick
    the brains of the core team members about how things got this way, and I'm
    here to share what I wish I'd known earlier. 

Diversity
=========

.. note:: 

    Diversity of thought causes problems. Yes, you heard that correctly. A
    community who all thinks the same is not diverse. 

    When you get enough diverse viewpoints, some will oppose others. When this
    happens about non-technical things, people get hurt and offended -- I can
    genuinely think it's cool to tell you how pretty you are and you can
    genuinely think it's horribly uncool and harrassing, and it doesn't matter
    who's right or wrong but most communities end up resolving "right" and
    "wrong" with trial by verbal combat. 

Code of Conduct
---------------

.. note::

    TODO get pic from steve
    Setting a CoC differentiates 2 kinds of people: Those who'll follow it and
    those who won't. "I'll just be nice" -> what about when your definition of
    "nice" violates CoC?

    Laying these ground rules before they're needed *homogenizes* the
    community by *excluding* the people who are unwilling to change. This
    gives us a chance at resolving disputes civilly, and it usually works!

    We plaster it everywhere -- discourse automatically shows it, it's all
    over github, Rust meetups flaunt it -- because keeping out the people who
    see trial by combat as the best solution makes the community a much more
    enjoyable place for the rest of us.     

Unappreciated Contributions
===========================

.. note::

    TODO: Graph up and to the right of time invested vs pain of rejection

    People get sad and angry when they put a bunch of their life into a new
    feature only to be told it's not what the project wants or needs. 

    Combine that with "pull requests welcome" as a synonym for "I don't want
    to explain all the things I dislike about that, but I don't think it's
    possible anyway, so please leave me alone", and you get people feeling
    rejected a lot.

RFC process
-----------

.. note:: 
    You don't get as attached to a written proposal that's explicitly only a
    suggestion. 

Recognition
-----------

* Weekly newsletter names "friend of the tree"
* First commits recognized in TWIR
* Community members built http://edunham.github.io/rust-org-stats/

Broken Tree
===========

.. note:: Why's it bad when the tree breaks?
