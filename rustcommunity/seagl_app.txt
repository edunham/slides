 Automated Community Management
Lessons from the Rust Programming Language

Rust's web site says that it's a systems programming language which runs
blazingly fast, prevents nearly all segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.
Behind the scenes, Rust is also a thriving community that welcomes new
contributors, consistently enforces its code of conduct, and maintains a
high-quality codebase.

I've recently joined the Rust community, and can provide a technical
perspective on how their automatic systems encourage good code and good
behavior. As someone who doesn't look like the average tech person, I've also
noticed the pitfalls of many communities' problematic attempts encourage
diversity, and have quantified the ways that Rust's community avoids these
hazards.
