What does it take to make projects in your ecosystem ask for CI?

What does it take to make contributors happy when the build breaks?


* CoC from the outset
* Go where the users are (Reddit, HN, Twitter); valued/included specialist
  (Steve)
* CoC has specific steps to be taken if there's a problem, plus community
  subteam

This setup automated the process of removing people who don't want to be part
of a project that cares about peoples' feelings. 

Now I sing JDM's praises for half an hour, because he's behind most of what I
think of as our "newbie-wrangling" automation: 

* Highfive
* Starters
* whatcanido et al

The Not Rocket Science Rule and Bors

http://graydon.livejournal.com/186550.html

This feels somewhere between mind-bogglingly obvious and outright impossible
depending on where you're from. Maybe both. BUT IT WORKS! 

My theory about how/why it works is that it gives everyone a common adversary. 

It rewards project members for writing good, comprehensive tests. 

Most importantly, it's often a robot rather than a person saying "no" to a bad
patch. Then your conversation with the people is "yeah, this is hard, but
we're all in it together". Saying no hurts. 

Additionally, I haven't seen core folks burning out on helping newbies the way
they do in other projects. Part of this is that we have great core folks; but
having a bot catch some of the PRs that need more work can't hurt. 

Best part of Bors? He's contagious. People try to carry the not rocket science
rule out into the ecosystem, and request help setting up CI because they've
seen it done right. 

Coolest place this phenomenon has spread: Crater.
