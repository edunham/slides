Procedure for doing a task

* Remember that writing exercise from middle school:
    * Describe how to make a PBJ
* Generalize that to how to make any sandwich
* This is a sandwich-making *algorithm*

Data Structures
===============

This is CS261 in 5 minutes.

Arrays/matrices
---------------

.. code-block:: python

    ['a', 'b', 'c']

2-dimensional

.. code-block:: python

    [['a', 'b', 'c'],
     ['d', 'e', 'f']]

Dimension is how deeply the lists are nested.

Lists
-----

Nodes joined together, where each node holds data

Singly-linked

Doubly-linked

Trees
-----

Binary Tree

Balanced

.. TODO: picture

-----
