Slides
======

Things I can talk about, for 5mins to 2 hours.

The parts I wrote are Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike. See LICENSE for
legalese. Pictures are (C) their respective owners, attributed in the slides
that use them.

You can find all the talks that I've given at events, with links to recordings
and archived copies of the slides as they stood then, at
