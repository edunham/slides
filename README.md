Slides
======

Things I can talk about, for half an hour to an hour, whenever requested.

The parts I wrote are Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike. See LICENSE for

that use them.

You can find all the talks that I've given at events, with links to recordings
and archived copies of the slides as they stood then, at
