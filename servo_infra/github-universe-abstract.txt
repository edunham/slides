Building a better browser engine on GitHub

The Servo browser engine, written in Rust, is a Mozilla initiative to test
novel approaches to rendering the web and build components to improve Firefox.
This talk is a tour through the infrastructure that powers Servo's
development, showing how the project leverages GitHub to build a welcoming and
highly productive international community. After this talk you'll understand
how Servo gets the most out of GitHub and hopefully be inspired to improve
your own projects with ideas from our tooling and culture as well.
