* What's Rust
    * Trifecta
    * Not Rocket Science
* What's Servo
    * Short history of development
    * N.R.S. rule tricke-down
    * Infra automation
        * Highfive/Starters
        * Borsing

The Future
* Teams are getting more distributed -> we've built tools for multi-TZ &
  multi-commitment-level group
* Products more complex -> more code reuse -> open tooling

What you can use:

    Not Rocket Science Rule
    Sell other teams on your tools by demonstrating value
    Justify time investment by building generic tooling to address everyone's problems
