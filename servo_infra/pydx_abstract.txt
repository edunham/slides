The Servo browser engine, written in Rust, is a Mozilla initiative to test
novel approaches to rendering the web and build components to improve Firefox.
This talk is a tour through the infrastructure code behind the scenes, showing
how the project uses Python at every step from greeting pull requests to
delivering nightly builds. You'll also learn how you can contribute to Servo
with your Python skills!
