GPG in the Real World

On a distributed DevOps team, securely communicating secret information is
essential. GPG keys have two primary uses: Signing files to verify the
identity of the person or machine who created them, and encrypting
communication so that files can only be decrypted by their intended recipient.
Although it sounds simple, GPG's implementations are notorious for being
difficult to use and understand. 

This talk will refresh your memory about GPG without delving too deeply into
the underlying mathematics, then focus mainly on common practical applications
beyond the scope of your average key-signing party: 

* Best practices for keeping your keys safe, without losing them
* Revoking compromised keys (and ensuring that you don't trust any key that
  has been compromised)
* Sharing the use of a signing key between team members
* And more!
