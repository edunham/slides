FABRICation, or "spatial ed", or "the sewing talk"

This'll cover the principles of how to make custom stuff, and maybe make you
realize that few things are worth making yourself if your time has value.

Sewing is like 3D printing except cheaper and more useful.

Patterns are code, and sewing is an unusually laborious compilation step.

Many historical traditions call it very bad luck to make something perfectly.

1) Materials.

* Wovens
* Knits

3) Making a pattern

* Decide what to make (mental 3D model)
* Biggest & smallest size of item?
* Planes already? Copy them
* Tape + paper, cut till flat
* move darts and seams
* Think about patterns
* Think about drape
* Think about stretch
* Note points that'll need to line up later
* Spoonflower
* Sometimes linings

4) Assembly

* Transfer pattern to fabric
    * Alignment, pattern & stretch
    * Seam allowance
    * Chalk etc
    * Printer? Draft? Cutting machine? Trace?

* ID your pieces, alignment points, etc

* Plan where the last seam will be, do it last

* Seams in or out? Good sides usually together
