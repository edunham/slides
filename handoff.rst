Passing the Torch: Our lessons from FOSS organization leadership handoff

Lessons from a successful leadership handoff in a volunteer outreach
organization

who we are: current pres and former pres

Eli's background

edunham's background

before:
    * familiar with annual cycles of group -- especially relevant b/c school
    * identified handoff timing 6-9months in advance, sketched timeline
    * documented EVERYTHING
    * fostered inclusive culture to give newbies a chance / encourage them to
      take it
    * i feel like i kind of forced my own opinions about newbies being
      important, etc. onto the group, but it didn't directly contradict
      existing opinions, so it worked okay

During: 
    * multiple candidates around
    * followed election process
    * worked really well to have old leadership step out and leave vacuum
      (with caveats of course)
    * most vocal candidates were *not* the ones who took more initiative in
      vacuum
    * allowed group to make informed decision when voting
    * voting provided communication and percieved buy-in -- might not have
      worked so well if we'd had a major schism or feud on at the time

After:
    * layered handoff -- old leadership kept helping with irc administration
      until new was confident in skills
    * careful of social karma -- pretty sure if i said one thing and Eli said
      the opposite, most of lug would follow me b/c friends for longer -- so
      make sure to not abuse that
    * mentorship & feedback without excessive puppetteering (though i've done
      a bit of that -- how'd it work/feel?)
    * Eli appears to have identified what was & wasn't working in my
      leadership, kept the good parts and added own touches. was that
      intentional?
    * revisited ideas that I'd had to veto years ago for reasons which are no
      longer relevant, and then just assumed that since i'd decided against
      them before, that decision remained right (cognitive biases)
        * & just more energy/optimism, less cynical, willing to try more
          things because thye haven't failed yet
