Outline

of himself

Individuals In Theory...
========================

IMAGE: page of book with sketch of stickman on it

You Live in a Human Emulator
----------------------------

IMAGE: stickman with stickman in a thoughtbubble

Homo Economicus
---------------

IMAGE: stickman with a tie and briefcase?

Maslow
------

IMAGE: stickman placing top of pyramid onto pyramid

MBTI
----



great at pattern recognition
----------------------------

ergo judgemental, quick to jump to conclusions.
IMAGE: stickman looking at several different sorts of dogs


Cognitive Biases
----------------

IMAGE: stickman looking at thing with warped version of thing in thogught
bubble (mistaking t-rex for dog?)

Overconfidence/Underconfidence effects
--------------------------------------

IMAGE: stickman fleeing from tiny dog (or offering a bone to a t-rex?)

Groups in Theory...
===================

Asch Conformity
---------------

IMAGE: stickman and sketch pointing at lines of different lengths

Milgram Obedience
-----------------

use the more modern less unethical remake

IMAGE: stickman with buttons and sketch in a lab coat

social scripts/expectations
---------------------------

IMAGE: sketch as an NPC dialog


bystander effect
----------------

IMAGE: stickman shrugging as crowd of sketch folks stand around

reciprocity
-----------

IMAGE: stickman giving something to sketch -> sketch giving something to
stickman (like a recycle symbol)


mirroring / body language
-------------------------

IMAGE: stickman and sketch leaning into a conversation in interest; stickman
trying to get away from sketch

Application Advice
==================

doing science
-------------

IMAGE: sketch in a labcoat

(be open-minded)

getting what you want
---------------------

IMAGE: stickman crushed under a pile of presents, waving for help

(be careful what you wish for)

recognize end of usefulness
---------------------------

generalizations useful for asking right questions, etc.

IMAGE: stickman pedantically proclaiming that dinosaur = dog?

use your words carefully
------------------------

some terms imply a goal or a set of values, ie right/wrong, fair/unfair,
good/bad. when using them, SPECIFY THE GOAL rather than trusting audience to
guess what you were thinking. 

Applications
============

recognizing social norms
------------------------

image: all the sketch folks wearing hats; stickman in a paper hat?


body language of online communication
-------------------------------------

IMAGE: same as for mirroring

mirroring speech styles

inviting conversation
---------------------

remember the part about living in a human emulator?

IMAGE: stickman with thought bubble of sketch with a speech bubble

effective email
---------------

IMAGE: stickman with a laptop, email dialog, single ? on it

ditto the human emulator

social hierarchies and capital
------------------------------

karma/popularity -- how do you judge others? 

IMAGE: sketch people crowdsurfing stickman

stalking skills
---------------

with the caveat that there are sometimes things you didn't want to know

IMAGE: stickman with binoculars?

As a FOSS Contributor
=====================

meritocracy
-----------

IMAGE: stickman writing code

currency is fucks given, often measured in lines of code. passion/enthusiasm
etc.

first impressions
-----------------

(that bit about pattern recognition) identify which patterns you'll match

IMAGE: irc convo over s's shoulder, "IM_NOT_LISTENING_TO_YOU" nick


asking good questions
---------------------

IMAGE: stickman with the madlibs in a speech bubble

fit the pattern of contributors who've turned out to be useful

routes into a project
---------------------

IMAGE: stickman with a treasure map

improving docs

routing around damage

they're ignoring my PRs!
------------------------

IMAGE: sketch shunning stickman (who's wearing a silly hat)

leveraging conferences
----------------------

IMAGE: stickman with a microphone, necktie

Leadership
==========

the emulator thing: which leaders do you look up to? why?

know your audience
------------------

IMAGE: stickman with microphone, bunch of sketch people

group culture
-------------

you can't just say "our culture is going to be x". there's already one there.

IMAGE: bunch of sketch people with big shared thought bubble with computer in
it, computer from email

avoiding discrimination
-----------------------

just inconsistent enforcement of rules, or different rules for different
people. priveledge == "private law". whether it's ok seems to be based on
whether it uses a differnce that people can control -- ie commit bit for those
with more code in the repo

IMAGE: stickman giving sketch a hat?


identify assumptions
--------------------

who's "everybody"? make statements about "everybody" in your group then
challenge each assumption

IMAGE: big sketch people with hats, little sketch person with no hat looking
confused

diversity
---------

recognize the difference between wanting people who *think differently* and
people who *look different*. 

IMAGE: stickman and sketch sharing a thoughtbubble with IRC computer in it,
other sketch with thoughtbubble of email computer


delegation
----------

EMPOWER minions
knowing it'll happen == knowing who'll do it

IMAGE: stickman handing sketch the map

delegation: Timing
------------------

IMAGE: calendar with can start, deadline, and lastminute. sketch on can start,
stickman on lastminute.

manage burnout
--------------

IMAGE: sketches waving papers at sad-looking Stickman

dropped balls aren't noticed as much as you think; monitor own state carefully
so burnout doesn't sneak up

burnout.io

leadership handoff
------------------

madlibs of tasks, share responsibilities, "puppet" them for smoother
transition if they're not confident yet, recognize their differences

IMAGE: stickman saying speechbubble of map to sketch, who says speech bubble
of map to crowd

troll-proofing
--------------

IMAGE: stickman with speech bubble with crossed-out troll


clear codes of conduct, clear expectations that reflect the community's
standards

buy-in from group on code of conduct

communications on the record -- encourages you to behave better, as well

and if that didn't work
-----------------------

IMAGE: stickman and troll talking, each has speech bubble with the other in it 


don't make it worse

if someone's unduly offended and just wants to make a scene, get them to
propose rules that could be enforced equally on everyone (sometimes helps
improve self-awareness)

also mirroring (BUT BE CAREFUL, works best when behavior is OTT patently
absurd)

get someone out
---------------

IMAGE: stickman and sketch shoving troll through a doorway

LAST resort
why aren't they able to play well with others?
    * path of least resistance? 
    * insufficient information?
avoid "right" and "wrong" -- all they'll do is alienate people and encourage
you to make unidentified assumptions
