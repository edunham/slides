.. note:: focuses... 
    pacing
    no questionmarks
    transitions
    fight tendency to get shrill when nervous
    kill the "kind of" -- use synonyms
    "umm"
    less mbti
    accent gets stronger when joking
    BEST FRIEND or DAD thinks they're better at driving than averae
    git by a bus (for good culture stuff?)... delegation+redundancy
    transition into dropped ball was good
    good reiteration on burnout stuff -- goes so fast it needs more repetition
    fewer words on the "automate yourself out of a job" for handoffs

Individuals In Theory...
========================

You Live in a Human Emulator
----------------------------

Homo Economicus
---------------

Maslow
------

MBTI
----

IMAGE: 3D of transparent 2x2x2 cubes, each 2 colors split

.. note:: test is designed to force dichotomies; during development tested
    thousands of questions to find those on which people statistically
    differentiate

          Extraversion vs Introversion "attitudes"
          Sensing vs Intuition -- percieving functions, what we do with
                                  information
          Feeling vs Thinking -- decision making functions
          Judging vs Percieving -- meta-types, J prefers order/predictable; P
                                   prefers spontaneous

.. note:: maybe an image of the lawful/chaotic good/evil D&D matrix as well?

.. note::
    "The Forer effect... is the observation that individuals will give high
    accuracy ratings to descriptions of their personality that supposedly are
    tailored specifically for them, but are in fact vague and general enough
    to apply to a wide range of people." -- horoscope effect...

    Subjective validation occurs when two unrelated or even random events are
    perceived to be related because a belief, expectation, or hypothesis
    demands a relationship.

Cognitive Biases
----------------

bubble (mistaking t-rex for dog?)

Overconfidence/Underconfidence effects
--------------------------------------

IMAGE: stickman fleeing from tiny dog (or offering a bone to a t-rex?)

great at pattern recognition
----------------------------

ergo judgemental, quick to jump to conclusions.
IMAGE: stickman looking at several different sorts of dogs

priming

Groups in Theory...
===================

Asch Conformity
---------------

IMAGE: stickman and sketch pointing at lines of different lengths

Milgram Obedience
-----------------

use the more modern less unethical remake

IMAGE: stickman with buttons and sketch with clipboard 

.. note:: 
        Milgram's book Obedience to Authority ISBN 0-06-176521-X 

        virtual representation, observes that humans empathize with an avatar
        and obey authority to shock it anyway 
        http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0000039

        partial reproduction, stopping at 150V to avoid traumatizing
        participants, in 2009
        http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/amp-64-1-1.pdf

        and the replicated it on a fake French game show in 2010 and, surprise
        surprise, people zap others for TV authority too
        http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124838091

social scripts/expectations
---------------------------

IMAGE: sketch as an NPC dialog

.. note:: get help with scripts example

bystander effect
----------------

IMAGE: stickman shrugging as crowd of sketch folks stand around

.. note:: 
   
    Somebody Else's Problem field, or SEP, is a cheap, easy, and staggeringly
    useful way of safely protecting something from unwanted eyes. It can run
    almost indefinitely on a flashlight/9 volt battery, and is able to do so
    because it utilizes a person's natural tendency to ignore things they
    don't easily accept, like, for example, aliens at a cricket match. Any
    object around which a S.E.P is applied will cease to be noticed, because
    any problems one may have understanding it (and therefore accepting its
    existence) become Somebody Else's. An object becomes not so much invisible
    as unnoticed. 

reciprocity
-----------

IMAGE: stickman giving something to sketch -> sketch giving something to
stickman (like a recycle symbol)

.. note:: attribution error, assumption that helps you -> likes you

mirroring / body language
-------------------------

IMAGE: stickman and sketch leaning into a conversation in interest; stickman
trying to get away from sketch

Application Advice
==================

doing science
-------------

IMAGE: sketch in a labcoat

(be open-minded)

getting what you want
---------------------

IMAGE: stickman crushed under a pile of presents, waving for help

(be careful what you wish for)

recognize end of usefulness
---------------------------

generalizations useful for asking right questions, etc.

IMAGE: stickman pedantically proclaiming that dinosaur = dog?

use your words carefully
------------------------

some terms imply a goal or a set of values, ie right/wrong, fair/unfair,
good/bad. when using them, SPECIFY THE GOAL rather than trusting audience to
guess what you were thinking. 

Applications
============

recognizing social norms
------------------------

image: all the sketch folks wearing hats; stickman in a paper hat?


body language of online communication
-------------------------------------

IMAGE: same as for mirroring

mirroring speech styles

inviting conversation
---------------------

remember the part about living in a human emulator?

IMAGE: stickman with thought bubble of sketch with a speech bubble

effective email
---------------

IMAGE: stickman with a laptop, email dialog, single ? on it

ditto the human emulator

social hierarchies and capital
------------------------------

karma/popularity -- how do you judge others? 

IMAGE: sketch people crowdsurfing stickman

stalking skills
---------------

.. note:: put free software or open source software or project name in search,
    use safesearch

with the caveat that there are sometimes things you didn't want to know

IMAGE: stickman with binoculars?

As a FOSS Contributor
=====================

.. note:: people are dumb, panicky animals quote was a REALLY GOOD transition

social capital
--------------

.. note:: move this?

recommendations are gambling

meritocracy
-----------

IMAGE: stickman writing code

currency is fucks given, often measured in lines of code. passion/enthusiasm
etc.

first impressions
-----------------

(that bit about pattern recognition) identify which patterns you'll match

IMAGE: irc convo over stickman's shoulder, "IM_NOT_LISTENING_TO_YOU" nick


asking good questions
---------------------

IMAGE: stickman with the madlibs in a speech bubble

fit the pattern of contributors who've turned out to be useful

.. note:: shows that you read the docs and that will make them very happy,
    especially the person who wrote the docs. 

routes into a project
---------------------

IMAGE: stickman with a treasure map

improving docs

.. note:: get out of dumb question free cards

routing around damage

they're ignoring my PRs!
------------------------

IMAGE: sketch shunning stickman (who's wearing a silly hat)

leveraging conferences
----------------------

IMAGE: stickman with a microphone, necktie

Leadership
==========

the emulator thing: which leaders do you look up to? why?

know your audience
------------------

IMAGE: stickman with microphone, bunch of sketch people

group culture
-------------

you can't just say "our culture is going to be x". there's already one there.

IMAGE: bunch of sketch people with big shared thought bubble with computer in
it, computer from email

avoiding discrimination
-----------------------

just inconsistent enforcement of rules, or different rules for different
people. priveledge == "private law". whether it's ok seems to be based on
whether it uses a differnce that people can control -- ie commit bit for those
with more code in the repo

IMAGE: stickman giving sketch a hat?


identify assumptions
--------------------

who's "everybody"? make statements about "everybody" in your group then
challenge each assumption

IMAGE: big sketch people with hats, little sketch person with no hat looking
confused

diversity
---------

recognize the difference between wanting people who *think differently* and
people who *look different*. 

IMAGE: stickman and sketch sharing a thoughtbubble with IRC computer in it,
other sketch with thoughtbubble of email computer


delegation
----------

EMPOWER minions
knowing it'll happen == knowing who'll do it

IMAGE: stickman handing sketch the map

delegation: Timing
------------------

IMAGE: calendar with can start, deadline, and lastminute. sketch on can start,
stickman on lastminute.

manage burnout
--------------

IMAGE: sketches waving papers at sad-looking Stickman

dropped balls aren't noticed as much as you think; monitor own state carefully
so burnout doesn't sneak up

burnout.io

leadership handoff
------------------

madlibs of tasks, share responsibilities, "puppet" them for smoother
transition if they're not confident yet, recognize their differences

IMAGE: stickman saying speechbubble of map to sketch, who says speech bubble
of map to crowd

troll-proofing
--------------

IMAGE: stickman with speech bubble with crossed-out troll


clear codes of conduct, clear expectations that reflect the community's
standards

buy-in from group on code of conduct

communications on the record -- encourages you to behave better, as well

and if that didn't work
-----------------------

IMAGE: stickman and troll talking, each has speech bubble with the other in it 


don't make it worse

if someone's unduly offended and just wants to make a scene, get them to
propose rules that could be enforced equally on everyone (sometimes helps
improve self-awareness)

also mirroring (BUT BE CAREFUL, works best when behavior is OTT patently
absurd)

get someone out
---------------

IMAGE: stickman and sketch shoving troll through a doorway

LAST resort
why aren't they able to play well with others?
    * path of least resistance? 
    * insufficient information?
avoid "right" and "wrong" -- all they'll do is alienate people and encourage
you to make unidentified assumptions
