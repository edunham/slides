Introduction

Outline

Individuals In Theory...
========================

You Live in a Human Emulator
----------------------------

Homo Economicus
---------------

Maslow
------

MBTI
----

Cognitive Biases
----------------

Overconfidence/Underconfidence effects
--------------------------------------

great at pattern recognition
----------------------------

ergo judgemental, quick to jump to conclusions.


Groups in Theory...
===================

Asch Conformity
---------------

Milgram Obedience
-----------------

use the more modern less unethical remake

social scripts/expectations
---------------------------

bystander effect
----------------

reciprocity
-----------

body language & mirroring
-------------------------

Application Advice
==================

doing science
-------------

(be open-minded)

getting what you want
---------------------

(be careful what you wish for)

recognize end of usefulness
---------------------------

generalizations useful for asking right questions, etc.

use your words carefully
------------------------

some terms imply a goal or a set of values, ie right/wrong, fair/unfair,
good/bad. when using them, SPECIFY THE GOAL rather than trusting audience to
guess what you were thinking. 

Applications
============

recognizing social norms
------------------------

body language of online communication
-------------------------------------

mirroring speech styles

inviting conversation
---------------------

remember the part about living in a human emulator?

effective email
---------------

ditto the human emulator

social hierarchies and capital
------------------------------

karma/popularity -- how do you judge others? 

stalking skills
---------------

with the caveat that there are sometimes things you didn't want to know

As a FOSS Contributor
=====================

meritocracy
-----------

currency is fucks given, often measured in lines of code. passion/enthusiasm
etc.

first impressions
-----------------

(that bit about pattern recognition) identify which patterns you'll match

asking good questions
---------------------

fit the pattern of contributors who've turned out to be useful

routes into a project
---------------------

improving docs

routing around damage

they're ignoring my PRs!
------------------------

leveraging conferences
----------------------

Leadership
==========

the emulator thing: which leaders do you look up to? why?

know your audience
------------------

group culture
-------------

you can't just say "our culture is going to be x". there's already one there.

avoiding discrimination
-----------------------

just inconsistent enforcement of rules, or different rules for different
people. priveledge == "private law". whether it's ok seems to be based on
whether it uses a differnce that people can control -- ie commit bit for those
with more code in the repo

identify assumptions
--------------------

who's "everybody"? make statements about "everybody" in your group then
challenge each assumption

diversity
---------

recognize the difference between wanting people who *think differently* and
people who *look different*. 

delegation
----------

EMPOWER minions
knowing it'll happen == knowing who'll do it

manage burnout
--------------

dropped balls aren't noticed as much as you think; monitor own state carefully
so burnout doesn't sneak up

burnout.io

leadership handoff
------------------

madlibs of tasks, share responsibilities, "puppet" them for smoother
transition if they're not confident yet, recognize their differences

troll-proofing
--------------

clear codes of conduct, clear expectations that reflect the community's
standards

buy-in from group on code of conduct

communications on the record -- encourages you to behave better, as well

and if that didn't work
-----------------------

don't make it worse

if someone's unduly offended and just wants to make a scene, get them to
propose rules that could be enforced equally on everyone (sometimes helps
improve self-awareness)

also mirroring (BUT BE CAREFUL, works best when behavior is OTT patently
absurd)

get someone out
---------------

LAST resort
why aren't they able to play well with others?
    * path of least resistance? 
    * insufficient information?
avoid "right" and "wrong" -- all they'll do is alienate people and encourage
you to make unidentified assumptions
