DevOpsing Your Resume

Despite the infamous shortage of engineers in our field, job hunting is
rarely regarded as a pleasant experience. Even the most competent engineers
often regard their resumes as minefields of technical debt.

In this quick tour of how to apply some DevOps best practices to your resume
or CV, we'll disucuss:

* Choosing the right tools for the job
	what criteria do you consider when you're about to devops for an application? 
		* is it maintained?
		* does it work?
		* when it breaks, how's that happen? does it break at bad times?
	hazards of vendor lock-in -- will you always have a copy of m$ fancything? will $startup always be around?
	expertise available to you -- what have you used in the past, or are your peers using now?

* The importance of version control
	tailoring resume to various hats you wear / types of opening you apply to could be a textbook example of branching + merging
	it should be easy to know what it looked like on a given date
* Organization and formatting to meet the users' needs
	who's your target audience -- recruiters? HR? the engineer interviewing you?
	what information do they need? (buzzwords, skills listing, quick and easy to read)
* Continuous delivery
	also a social engineering trick around the "you updated your resume! are you leaving?" thing
	easier to update bit by bit than all at once
* Where & how to reuse content
	in your bio on your website, stackoverflow, company intranet social thingy -- summary of the highlights
	on your LinkedIn -- every point should be mirrored, and often more verbose there
	

Recognizing that your resume is just another piece of code can reduce the
uncertainty of job hunting, free up time for the projects you care about, and
help you strengthen your personal brand.
