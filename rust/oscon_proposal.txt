As a technology professional, you know that it's important to keep up with the
latest tools and languages available in your field. But it can be overwhelming
to try to figure out how to get started. 

This talk will walk you through the best practices for how to approach
learning a new tool or language, find resources, and engage with its
community. We'll discuss the essential questions you need to ask when
taking up a new language or project, and what their answers are for Rust.

You'll leave this talk fully prepared to start working on your first Rust
