OSCON Proposal

Title: Avoiding Burnout with Community Leadership Handoffs

As active participants in FOSS communities, we often see the disastrous
effects that a project leader's burnout can have on their group. In this talk,
Elijah Caine and Emily Dunham will share what they learned from the successful
leadership handoff of one of the largest active Linux Users Groups in Oregon. 

Topics will include how to avoid the pitfalls which the group encountered in
previous transitions, the unique challenges faced by all-volunteer groups of
busy people, how we fostered a group culture that facilitates successful
transitions. Throught the talk, we'll emphasize how you can apply the basic
leadership skills which tie it all together.

Passing the Torch: Our lessons from FOSS organization leadership handoff

Lessons from a successful leadership handoff in a volunteer outreach
organization



* transitioning leadership
  * what worked for us, when, etc.
  * **don't keep going till you burn out**
* leadership of FOSS/volunteers


framing assumptions, clear on what's our use case vs what's general
* what, why, how it might generalize -- adapt these ideas

what's the problem / why do you care
====================================

people get excited, do difficult things,  burn out, and sabotage own work by
burning out wrong

*you* get excited, build a thing, want it to keep going, then drop it? bad.

your experiences with burnout, abandoned repos, etc.

fail fast, plan ahead

who we are: current pres and former pres
========================================

Eli's background

edunham's background

LUG's background
================

FOSS fan club
firefox glory days
neckbeard circle
"I have a job at Google; it's your problem now, bye"
    * highly educational
    * reasonable expectation of "just figure it out"
      * "in case of emergency" section
switch in leadership styles (obviously) alienated some people -- too late to
tell whether smoother transition would've prevented this
* lacked the metric of being PUBLICLY watched / approved of by old leader
* perception of "supervised by responsible adult" -- transfers group's
  approval?

"the before times"
------------------

problem of media personalities evolving their style without alienating fanbase
-- ie youtube

excitement/enthusiasm/interest is a resource

showing up to be social vs "why should someone come here instead of staying
home" -- if *i* could sit on my couch IRCing instead of going to a meeting,
choice is obvious -- hack days are easy but make them a backup plan

uncomfortable to "neckbeards" because LoC "gamification" / quantification of
quality or community value -- our demogaphic is people who like metrics --
touchy-feely-vague things are uncomfortable -- re-cast to heads in the room,
then Eli's metric is "excitement in the room", as many people engaged as
possible, teaching people to want to interact is the next big adventure

how it was when someone came in -> how they treat newbies when they're older

before:
    * familiar with annual cycles of group -- especially relevant b/c school
    * identified handoff timing 6-9months in advance, sketched timeline
    * documented EVERYTHING
    * fostered inclusive culture to give newbies a chance / encourage them to
      take it
      * leverage relationship between experience and cynicism
      * pivoted purpose from lines of code meritocracy
      * lines of code vs... inclusiveness? enthusiasm? hours of effort? "made
        it a little wishy-washy" -- care about more skills/aptitudes than JUST
        code -- made it less scary?
      * metric of heads in the room, rather than lines of code on the
        internet? i count people in the room rather than users of the
        attendees' projects?
    * i feel like i kind of forced my own opinions about newbies being
      important, etc. onto the group, but it didn't directly contradict
      existing opinions, so it worked okay

During: 
    * multiple candidates around
    * followed election process
    * worked really well to have old leadership step out and leave vacuum
      (with caveats of course)
    * most vocal candidates were *not* the ones who took more initiative in
      vacuum
       * it facilitated EXPERIMENTATION
       * allows old lead to create simulation of absence and improve
         mentorship
       * "sandbox period" allows people to show they have whatever it is that
         the group values
    * allowed group to make informed decision when voting
    * voting provided communication and percieved buy-in -- might not have
      worked so well if we'd had a major schism or feud on at the time
      * also we lucked out by not having trolls around -- they complicate
        everything
    * public communication of mentorship is good for community -- everyone
      feels in the look, "adult supervision" effect, etc.
      * we've done it on IRC a bit
      * we could've improved by using public channels better

After:
    * **layered handoff** -- old leadership kept helping with irc administration
      until new was confident in skills
      * explore this in LUG policy / bylaws
    * careful of social karma -- pretty sure if i said one thing and Eli said
      the opposite, most of lug would follow me b/c friends for longer -- so
      make sure to not abuse that
    * mentorship & feedback without excessive puppetteering (though i've done
      a bit of that -- how'd it work/feel?)
      * in THIS CASE, helped with transitioning -- clear cutoff but smooth
        transition of style, if that's what you want
      * would be different *feel* if transition more abrupt -- sock puppeting
        helped hand off club respect?
    * Eli appears to have identified what was & wasn't working in my
      leadership, kept the good parts and added own touches. was that
      intentional?
    * revisited ideas that I'd had to veto years ago for reasons which are no
      longer relevant, and then just assumed that since i'd decided against
      them before, that decision remained right (cognitive biases)
        * & just more **energy/optimism**, less cynical, willing to try more
          things because they haven't failed yet
        * good leadership redirects **excitement** rather than shutting it down --
          caveat on puppeteering
            * "the only things that make stuff happen in the world are
              excitement and money" -- leadership running out of excitement =
              project running out of fuel
        * explaining what's on my map of the territory without totally vetoing
          ideas that would've been bad years ago
        * respect that the new leadership style will find different things
          easy/difficult

Leadership Skills
=================

communication - know your audience, right info, right amount of info, right
timing, goals, how you can help

shield them from the bureaucracy while offering option to get more involved

not taking away opportunities from those willing to take a bit of the work

not making the group your whole identity -- criticism of group is not a
personal attack
    * spiteful criticism -- try to turn it into constructive criticism, the
      trolls get lazy and wander off
    * assume the best of all feedback (vanya questions story)

organization -- compulsive calendar usage
* Eli's checklists vs edunham's g-cal -- github gist

delegation -- sockpuppets, yay!
    * who to delegate to
    * when to remind to preserve motivation yet get the task done
    * reasonable fallback plans
    * "the people that matter want to help, so giving them something to do to
      help makes them a stronger part of the community" (alt. to LoC
      meritocracy?)

case-by-case vs formal handoff of permissions in computers -- i say
case-by-case b/c person who used to use the bits has best understanding of how
they're needed --
