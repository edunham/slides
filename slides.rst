Doing the Conferences Thing
===========================

(public speaking with open source tools?)

Who am I?

Why listen to me?

Why would you want to present? 

* fame and glory
* share cool toys
* teaching & giving back
* all of the above

But I can't...

* afford it? pick confs with scholarships or local
* Scared of public speaking? this is how you learn; audiences are supportive
* don't have skills? get into the market of newbietalks; your recent ignorance 
  is an ADVANTAGE

.. note:: 

    but i do'nt know everything! i always have to ask for help! 
    talks are a form of documentation; you're assisting those you asked

Ok but how?

* find a topic
* find a conference
* apply (A LOT)

Slides When?

* Outline as soon as you pick topic -- inspired; you can clean it up later
  (look at *my* git history)
* Try to work on them regularly (habitrpg)
* feature freeze before rehearsing -- artificial deadline; pull your
  all-nighter early
* ignore the people who try to glorify night-before slides; they're just
  jealous

Rehearse

* record yourself. yes you have to. sorry. i know it sucks.

Tools

Traits of slides

* easy to VCS
* sufficient control of appearance (what's 'sufficient' for you?)
* look good when speaking
* iterate fast (not too much boilerplate)
* distribution later (speaker notes or no?)
