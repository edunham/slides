Feedback?
---------

If you've seen one of my talks in person or online and have an opinion about
it, please let me know! Email dunhame@onid.orst.edu or IRC edunham on
freenode.net with your thoughts. 

I'm especially interested in suggestions for improving the abstracts and
organization of each presentation, since I often reuse the same slides a few
times.

Where are the slides from $CONFERENCE?

used at it.

Are the talks recorded?

When recordings are available, they're linked from the snapshot of the slides
from that conference.

Maybe! Email me (dunhame@onid.orst.edu) or ping me (edunham on

Will you speak at $CONFERENCE?
------------------------------

Probably! If it's outside the Pacific Northwest, I might need travel and
housing assistance, since I'm still a student.
