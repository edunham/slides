You Should Speak
----------------

Have you ever wanted to speak at a conference, but not known whether you're
good enough or how to start? I was in the same situation 2 years ago, but
since then I've given over a dozen talks at a variety of different tech
conferences.

These tricks will be helpful for experienced presenters looking to learn new
skills, as well as novice speakers who need some help getting started.


This talk will share solutions to many of the problems which aspiring speakers
encounter, including:

* Overcoming fear of public speaking
    - recognize value of your experience throgh similarity to others' -- you
      wasted n hours on this? will others do the same?
    - identify what makes you enjoy a talk -- competence, thorough
      preparation, humor, bravery. thorough preparation and bravery are free.
    - worst-case scenarios
    - MANAGING EXPECTATIONS (you probably already have these skills, from
      school or employment)

* Choosing a topic to talk about
    - where does your time go? seriously. log, hour by hour, what you're doing
      at work for a week. are there "learning about"s? congrats, you might be
      an expert. and it might be hard.
    - have you met a lucky 10,000 lately? met several on the same topic? you
      might be an expert. 
    - have you wished for the definitive guide to <thing>? wished badly enough
      to make you willing to write it? (this was my Git talk. people loved
      it.)

    OPEN TOOLS: notes and reminder applications

    - Budget. Will work pay to send you exotic places if you talk about
      something work-related? Are you limited to conferences that reimburse
      travel, or offer stipends? Might have to craft talk to fit such a CFP.

* Aside: Value of the Noob
    - the farther you are from new to a topic, the harder it is to teach
    - run your talk by a mentor so you don't disgrace yourself in public
    - experts tend to forget what parts are confusing as a noob. this means
      if you're JUST BARELY DE-NOOBED, you're in the BEST place to bootstrap
      others.

    OPEN TOOLS: aggregate existing docs and teach it with your own spin
 
* Finding the right conference for your topic
    - travel budget...
    - Search by theme + location
    - Can you spin your talk to fit with the theme? 
    - Super keen on getting in? For many confs, it's ok to offer a couple
      *disparate* ideas. Differentiate them clearly, and craft your bio to
      mention all fields you claim relevance in.

    OPEN TOOLS: stalk other speakers' portfolios; oreilly list; my calendar?

* Aside: Speaker Bios
    - Typically 3rd-person blurb, though you can pull off genderless (see my
      LCA one)
    - Achievement, achievement, fun humanizing fact <use one of Corey's>
    - These often show up in the program
    - Several purposes: Credibility to organizers, credibility to audience
    - Demonstrate English fluency. If your writing is dodgy, it's easy to
      imagine your talk as an unpleasant experience with a
      too-thick-to-understand accent. This would totally happen to me if I
      tried to present in my own second language. 

    OPEN TOOLS: that job description analyzer thing; also hemingway app

* Marketing a talk proposal with a convincing abstract
    - Know your audience? Serve your audience. Bring value to your audience.
      Trade show? Make it easy for them to demonstrate the value of the conf
      to their bosses. Hobby show? Give them something they hadn't thought of
      before. 
    - Abstract shows that you know your audience and can speak well to them. 
    - I've been quite successful with an abstract style that opens with a
      question directed at my target audience, when it's aligned with the
      conf's audience and goals
    - Read other abstracts from presenters at the conf to see what they have
      in common, and especially those of non-accepted talks (if public). Keep
      in mind the year's theme. 
    - Abstract promises what you'll deliver. Pick a realistic goal, then
      polish it to sound as good as possible. Be careful making technical
      promises; you'll be stuck with them. 

* Designing powerful slides
    - What are *your* favorite slides? 
    - What happens when an audience gets bored? (tweeting during talks)
    - Be aware of different learning styles, how your learning style biases
      your preferences, how you can accomodate those who learn differently
      from how you teach
    - The "Don't"s:
        * Unreadable stuff when it should be readable
            * walls of text
            * poor contrast
            * tiny or terrible fonts
        * Distractions / unwanted diversions
        * Excessive dependence on slides (have a backup plan if the
          projector's illegible to those in the back)
        * Talk too fast
            * Too many slides -> pressure to hurry
            * Well paced or evenly timed -> reminder to stretch content when
              needed
            * Too few -> chaos and disasters, unless you've practiced a LOT
        * Don't bikeshed too hard about tools.
    - What's left? (the "Do"s)
        * One slide per 1-5min topic (depending on your style)
        * Slide focuses the chunk of information they need
        * Slide augments words with a key term, image, or number
        * If transitions are important, stick them in your speaker console
    - minimalism
    - consistent theme
    OPEN TOOLS: hemingwrite

* Finding open-source presentation software that fits your needs
    - First, identify your needs. 
        * Speaker console?
        * Printable?
        * Web-able?
            * mobile?
        * Single-file-able?
    - How's your relationship with technology? Will fancy typesetting entice
      you to work on your slides, or scare you away from them?
    - What kind of graphic design will make you feel most confident on stage?
      Globally agreeable but generic, or customized to show off your skills?
    - How will you distribute the slides after the talk?

    - There are many tools. For example: 

        I sometimes need a speaker console. Some confs want me to reduce the
        slides to a single, "printable" file. I like keeping all my old talks
        online, as mementoes and reference material. 

        I like writing a text file that describes my slides, then typing a
        magic incantation which emits a visually pleasing file. My slides tend
        to have big letters and full-screen photos. 

        I started out with Hieroglyph, for an education project where the
        slides were also built as Sphinx docs. I wrote .rst slides, had many
        directories per presentation, and often ended up in Pandoc hell.
        Recently I've been playing with reveal.js, since it's more featureful
        than dzslides, snazzier than Hieroglyph, etc.

    - LibreOffice Impress
    - Hieroglyph
    - dzslides
    - Beamer
    - reveal.js
    - buid your own

    - your presentation is not "done" until you can give it from 90% of the
      computers in the room, at 5mins notice, without internet connectivity
      during the talk.

* Taunting the Demo Gods
    - Live demonstrations will probably fail. This is accepted as a fact of
      life. Are you okay with failing awkwardly in public?
    - if not, there are options:
        * record the demo as a series of gifs
            * ffcast
            * http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/113695/gif-screencasting-the-unix-way
        * terminal-only? 
            * https://asciinema.org/
    - have a backup option anyway. Laptops like to die and lose local files on
      the night before a big presentation.

* Getting It Done
    - Self-reflection: When have you completed a task that seemed daunting at
      first? WHY did you succeed? When have you undertaken a task that seemed
      daunting but failed it? WHY did you fail? OK, how can you apply the
      things that infuence your failure/success to this talk? 
      
      Examples: feel more motivated in the spring? pick a conference in early
      summer. get overwhelmed by household responsibilities? work with others
      to help alleviate them. More productive during finals week due to
      procrastination? time things accordingly!

    - Brain hack: False Deadlines. When you tell a friend, partner, etc. about
      how nervous you are to give this talk and they ask what they can do,
      here's your answer: you're going to have an appointment with them to run
      through your talk and get their feedback. You'll have your slides done.
      They're to accept no excuses. Do this on a person you respect and fear
      disappointing, and you'll pull your all-nighter before the rehersal
      rather than before the real thing. A Saturday morning is great for this
      -- it's okay for you to be kinda dead the rest of the weekend, and you
      can capitalize on the energy you get from the adrenaline + their
      feedback to make some progress after the rehersal. 

      Really any kind of appointment for feedback is great for this, including
      doing your talk at a local users group. It's okay to suck the first few
      times. 

    - Brain hack: gamification. Using GitHub's commit graph or a similar
      "streak tracker", make some progress (however small) to your talk every
      day. Remember to note necessary improvements (use a tag like TODO or
      FIXME that you can easily grep for) -- on one day you might have an
      easier time coming up with tasks that need to be done but a tough time
      completing them, and on another day you just want a straightforward task
      to complete without having to get inspired. That's okay; both are forms
      of progress. 

* Boilerplate slides:
    - First slide: Talk title, your name, the date, perhaps conf name
        * It'll sit there on the screen while people file in. Reassure them
          that they have the right room.
    - Post-intro: Link to the slides online so folks can follow along. 
    - Last slide: Contact info, link to where the slides are published online.
      Yes, publish your slides BEFORE the talk. 


* Common Sense
    - Make progress when you have energy/inspiration. Putting a TODO into your
      slides, or a "hey go find that thing", is totally progress. Get in the
      habit of fiddling with your slides when procrastinating something else,
      but *check on overall progress regularly*. 
    - Back up all the things. Every time you make any progress, save the file.
      Every time you remember (at least end of every session of work)
      duplicate the changes to a trustworthy offsite backup (yes, GitHub
      counts)
    - Rehearse a bunch. The first recording is terrible and awkward, and you
      will have to listen to at least one recording of your talk. It's less
      cringey to do this in private than to have it be the official
      conference-provided version
    - Run it by non-experts for a sanity check on whether your content's
      organization makes sense... but feature freeze at least 2 rehersals
      before the real talk. Better oddly organized and well presented than
      perfect slides and a talk that falls apart around them.
    - Seriously, this is the advice that you'd make up if you were coaching a
      friend on giving a talk and *just making it up*.
    

* Conference logistics
    - make sure you know when, how travel/transit will work, where you're
      staying, how commitments at home will be handled in your absence, etc.
    - ask speaker liason w/ any questions; know who/how will help you with
      technical difficulties at the conf
    - do you have to register? register.
    - figure out travel, housing, food, and caffeine logistics well in
      advance. Don't make assumptions about what the conference provides. I've
      been to a conf that provided coffee+breakfast on the first 2 days but
      not the 3rd, and didn't publish this fact.
    - Get what you need to be confident and energetic on stage. This might
      include sufficient sleep, breakfast, lunch, remembering to take a
      prescription reliably for the week before, caffeine at a certain time...
      figure out what you need, plan for it, have a backup plan.
    - Practice making your laptop talk to the projectors in advance. Have a
      backup plan (borrow a computer from the conf or a colleague in the
      audience?) for if something goes catastrophically wrong. 

* At the Conference
    - Find the speaker lounge, figure out what the staff and tech support
      folks look like (often matching tshirts, sometimes special badges)
    - Bring the stuff you need on the day of your talk. Laptop, charger,
      phone, water bottle, favorite hat...
    - If possible, practice setting up with the actual projector on the day of
      your talk.  
    - Skip the session before yours, or attend the session in the same room.
      Go up right after the presenter finishes, plug in, etc. Silence your
      phone and onscreen notifications, or friends in the audience will ping
      you. Close windows and log out of accounts that you wouldn't want to
      show the whole world.
    - Reread the abstract in the program describing the talk in the room at
      the time that you're speaking. Remember that that's what the audience
      has shown up for!
    - Relax, keep an eye on the time

* Handling Q&A

    - Scoping the talk clearly and managing expectations
    - It's ok to say "I don't know", especially with "but I'd find out by ___"
        * Promise to test something? get their email/IRC and follow up.
          seriously.
    - Repeat the question for the audience
    - can't understand their accent? it's ok to say "I'm sorry, I'm having a
      hard time understanding you" and attempt to rephrase question based on
      the words you could pick out. 
    - It's ok to cut off somebody telling their life story and ask them to get
      to the point
    - It's ok to ask people to contact you "offline" if time runs out. Bonus
      points for blogging the discussions/answers, though.
