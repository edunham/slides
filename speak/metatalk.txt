You Should Speak
----------------

Have you ever wanted to speak at a conference, but not known whether you're
good enough or how to start? I was in the same situation 2 years ago, but
since then I've given over a dozen talks at a variety of different tech
conferences.

This talk will share solutions to many of the problems which aspiring speakers
encounter, including:

* Overcoming fear of public speaking
    - recognize value of your experience throgh similarity to others' -- you
      wasted n hours on this? will others do the same?
    - identify what makes you enjoy a talk -- competence, thorough
      preparation, humor, bravery. thorough preparation and bravery are free.
    - worst-case scenarios
    - MANAGING EXPECTATIONS (you probably already have these skills, from
      school or employment)

* Choosing a topic to talk about
    - where does your time go? seriously. log, hour by hour, what you're doing
      at work for a week. are there "learning about"s? congrats, you might be
      an expert. and it might be hard.
    - have you met a lucky 10,000 lately? met several on the same topic? you
      might be an expert. 
    - have you wished for the definitive guide to <thing>? wished badly enough
      to make you willing to write it? (this was my Git talk. people loved
      it.)

    OPEN TOOLS: notes and reminder applications

    - Budget. Will work pay to send you exotic places if you talk about
      something work-related? Are you limited to conferences that reimburse
      travel, or offer stipends? Might have to craft talk to fit such a CFP.

* Aside: Value of the Noob
    - the farther you are from new to a topic, the harder it is to teach
    - run your talk by a mentor so you don't disgrace yourself in public
    - experts tend to forget what parts are confusing as a noob. this means
      if you're JUST BARELY DE-NOOBED, you're in the BEST place to bootstrap
      others.

    OPEN TOOLS: aggregate existing docs and teach it with your own spin
 
* Finding the right conference for your topic
    - travel budget...
    - Search by theme + location
    - Can you spin your talk to fit with the theme? 
    - Super keen on getting in? For many confs, it's ok to offer a couple
      *disparate* ideas. Differentiate them clearly, and craft your bio to
      mention all fields you claim relevance in.

    OPEN TOOLS: stalk other speakers' portfolios; oreilly list; my calendar?

* Aside: Speaker Bios
    - Typically 3rd-person blurb, though you can pull off genderless (see my
      LCA one)
    - Achievement, achievement, fun humanizing fact <use one of Corey's>
    - These often show up in the program
    - Several purposes: Credibility to organizers, credibility to audience
    - Demonstrate English fluency. If your writing is dodgy, it's easy to
      imagine your talk as an unpleasant experience with a
      too-thick-to-understand accent. This would totally happen to me if I
      tried to present in my own second language. 

    OPEN TOOLS: that job description analyzer thing; also hemingway app

* Marketing a talk proposal with a convincing abstract
    - Know your audience? Serve your audience. Bring value to your audience.
      Trade show? Make it easy for them to demonstrate the value of the conf
      to their bosses. Hobby show? Give them something they hadn't thought of
      before. 
    - Abstract shows that you know your audience and can speak well to them. 
    - I've been quite successful with an abstract style that opens with a
      question directed at my target audience, when it's aligned with the
      conf's audience and goals
    - Read other abstracts from presenters at the conf to see what they have
      in common, and especially those of non-accepted talks (if public). Keep
      in mind the year's theme. 
    - Abstract promises what you'll deliver. Pick a realistic goal, then
      polish it to sound as good as possible. Be careful making technical
      promises; you'll be stuck with them.

* Designing powerful slides
    - What are *your* favorite slides? 
    - What happens when an audience gets bored? (tweeting during talks)
    - Be aware of different learning styles, how your learning style biases
      your preferences, how you can accomodate those who learn differently
      from how you teach
    - The "Don't"s:
        * Unreadable stuff when it should be readable
            * walls of text
            * poor contrast
            * tiny or terrible fonts
        * Distractions / unwanted diversions
        * Excessive dependence on slides (have a backup plan if the
          projector's illegible to those in the back)
        * Talk too fast
            * Too many slides -> pressure to hurry
            * Well paced or evenly timed -> reminder to stretch content when
              needed
            * Too few -> chaos and disasters, unless you've practiced a LOT
        * Don't bikeshed too hard about tools.
    - What's left? (the "Do"s)
        * One slide per 1-5min topic (depending on your style)
        * Slide focuses the chunk of information they need
        * Slide augments words with a key term, image, or number
        * If transitions are important, stick them in your speaker console

* Finding open-source presentation software that fits your needs
    - First, identify your needs. 
        * Speaker console?
        * Printable?
        * Web-able?
            * mobile?
        * Single-file-able?
    - How's your relationship with technology? Will fancy typesetting entice
      you to work on your slides, or scare you away from them?
    - What kind of graphic design will make you feel most confident on stage?
      Globally agreeable but generic, or customized to show off your skills?
    - How will you distribute the slides after the talk?

    - There are many tools. For example: 

        I sometimes need a speaker console. Some confs want me to reduce the
        slides to a single, "printable" file. I like keeping all my old talks
        online, as mementoes and reference material. 

        I like writing a text file that describes my slides, then typing a
        magic incantation which emits a visually pleasing file. My slides tend
        to have big letters and full-screen photos. 

        I started out with Hieroglyph, for an education project where the
        slides were also built as Sphinx docs. I wrote .rst slides, had many
        directories per presentation, and often ended up in Pandoc hell.
        Recently I've been playing with reveal.js, since it's more featureful
        than dzslides, snazzier than Hieroglyph, etc.

    - LibreOffice Impress
    - Hieroglyph
    - dzslides
    - Beamer
    - reveal.js
    - buid your own

* Designing powerful slides
    - minimalism
    - complementary art
    - consisten theme

* Getting It Done
    - Self-reflection: When have you completed a task that seemed daunting at
      first? WHY did you succeed? When have you undertaken a task that seemed
      daunting but failed it? WHY did you fail? OK, how can you apply the
      things that infuence your failure/success to this talk? 
      
      Examples: feel more motivated in the spring? pick a conference in early
      summer. get overwhelmed by household responsibilities? work with others
      to help alleviate them. More productive during finals week due to
      procrastination? time things accordingly!

    - Brain hack: False Deadlines. When you tell a friend, partner, etc. about
      how nervous you are to give this talk and they ask what they can do,
      here's your answer: you're going to have an appointment with them to run
      through your talk and get their feedback. You'll have your slides done.
      They're to accept no excuses. Do this on a person you respect and fear
      disappointing, and you'll pull your all-nighter before the rehersal
      rather than before the real thing. A Saturday morning is great for this
      -- it's okay for you to be kinda dead the rest of the weekend, and you
      can capitalize on the energy you get from the adrenaline + their
      feedback to make some progress after the rehersal. 

      Really any kind of appointment for feedback is great for this, including
      doing your talk at a local users group. It's okay to suck the first few
      times. 

    - Brain hack: gamification. Using GitHub's commit graph or a similar
      "streak tracker", make some progress (however small) to your talk every
      day. Remember to note necessary improvements (use a tag like TODO or
      FIXME that you can easily grep for) -- on one day you might have an
      easier time coming up with tasks that need to be done but a tough time
      completing them, and on another day you just want a straightforward task
      to complete without having to get inspired. That's okay; both are forms
      of progress. 

These tricks will be helpful for experienced presenters looking to learn new
skills, as well as novice speakers who need some help getting started.
