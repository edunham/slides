You Should Speak

Have you ever wanted to speak at a conference, but not known whether you’re
good enough or how to start? I was in the same situation 2 years ago, but
since then I’ve given over a dozen talks at a variety of different tech
conferences. As well as testing and refining my own solutions to the
challenges that face new speakers, I’ve learned what works and doesn’t work
for others.

This talk will share solutions, often in the form of open-source tools, to
many of the problems which aspiring speakers encounter, including:

Overcoming fear of public speaking
Choosing a topic to talk about
Finding the right conference for your topic
Marketing a talk proposal with a convincing abstract
Finding open-source presentation software that fits your needs
Designing powerful slides

These tricks will be helpful for experienced presenters looking to learn new
skills, as well as novice speakers who need some help getting started.
