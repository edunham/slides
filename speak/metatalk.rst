You Should Speak
----------------

Have you ever wanted to speak at a conference, but not known whether you're
good enough or how to start? I was in the same situation 2 years ago, but
since then I've given over a dozen talks at a variety of different tech
conferences.

This talk will share solutions to many of the problems which aspiring speakers
encounter, including:

* Overcoming fear of public speaking
    - recognize value of your experience throgh similarity to others' -- you
      wasted n hours on this? will others do the same?
    - identify what makes you enjoy a talk -- competence, thorough
      preparation, humor, bravery. thorough preparation and bravery are free.
    - worst-case scenarios
    - MANAGING EXPECTATIONS (you probably already have these skills, from
      school or employment)

* Choosing a topic to talk about
    - where does your time go? seriously. log, hour by hour, what you're doing
      at work for a week. are there "learning about"s? congrats, you might be
      an expert. and it might be hard.
    - have you met a lucky 10,000 lately? met several on the same topic? you
      might be an expert. 
    - have you wished for the definitive guide to <thing>? wished badly enough
      to make you willing to write it? (this was my Git talk. people loved
      it.)
    - Budget. Will work pay to send you exotic places if you talk about
      something work-related? Are you limited to conferences that reimburse
      travel, or offer stipends? Might have to craft talk to fit such a CFP.

* Aside: Value of the Noob
    - the farther you are from new to a topic, the harder it is to teach
    - run your talk by a mentor so you don't disgrace yourself in public
    - experts tend to forget what parts are confusing as a noob. this means
      if you're JUST BARELY DE-NOOBED, you're in the BEST place to bootstrap
      others.
 
* Finding the right conference for your topic
    - travel budget...
    - Search by theme + location
    - Can you spin your talk to fit with the theme? 
    - Super keen on getting in? For many confs, it's ok to offer a couple
      *disparate* ideas. Differentiate them clearly, and craft your bio to
      mention all fields you claim relevance in.

* Aside: Speaker Bios
    - Typically 3rd-person blurb
    - Achievement, achievement, fun humanizing fact <use one of Corey's>
    - These often show up in the program
    - Several purposes: Credibility to organizers, credibility to audience
    - Demonstrate English fluency. If your writing is dodgy, it's easy to
      imagine your talk as an unpleasant experience with a
      too-thick-to-understand accent. This would totally happen to me if I
      tried to present in my own second language. 

* Marketing a talk proposal with a convincing abstract
    - Know your audience? Serve your audience. Bring value to your audience.
      Trade show? Make it easy for them to demonstrate the value of the conf
      to their bosses. Hobby show? Give them something they hadn't thought of
      before. 
    - Abstract shows that you know your audience and can speak well to them. 
    - I've been quite successful with an abstract style that opens with a
      question directed at my target audience, when it's aligned with the
      conf's audience and goals
    - Read other abstracts from presenters at the conf to see what they have
      in common, and especially those of non-accepted talks (if public). Keep
      in mind the year's theme. 
    - Abstract promises what you'll deliver. Pick a realistic goal, then
      polish it to sound as good as possible. Be careful making technical
      promises; you'll be stuck with them. 

* Finding open-source presentation software that fits your needs
* Designing powerful slides

These tricks will be helpful for experienced presenters looking to learn new
skills, as well as novice speakers who need some help getting started.
