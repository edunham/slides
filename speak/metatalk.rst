You Should Speak
----------------

Have you ever wanted to speak at a conference, but not known whether you're
good enough or how to start? I was in the same situation 2 years ago, but
since then I've given over a dozen talks at a variety of different tech
conferences.

This talk will share solutions to many of the problems which aspiring speakers
encounter, including:

* Overcoming fear of public speaking
* Choosing a topic to talk about
* Finding the right conference for your topic
* Marketing a talk proposal with a convincing abstract
* Finding open-source presentation software that fits your needs
* Designing powerful slides

These tricks will be helpful for experienced presenters looking to learn new
skills, as well as novice speakers who need some help getting started.
