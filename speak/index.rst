Doing the Conferences Thing
===========================

    Have you ever thought about speaking at a conference, then come up with
    some excuse like "I don't know enough", "I'm scared of public speaking",
    or "I don't know where to apply"? Come to this talk to learn how to
    combine the open source tools and technolgies which solve all of those
    problems and more!

    Have you ever wanted to speak at a conference, but not known whether
    you’re good enough or how to start? I was in the same situation 2 years
    ago, but since then I’ve given over a dozen talks at a variety of
    different tech conferences. As well as testing and refining my own
    solutions to the challenges that face new speakers, I’ve learned what
    works and doesn’t work for others.

    This talk will share solutions, often in the form of open-source tools, to
    many of the problems which aspiring speakers encounter, including:

    * Overcoming fear of public speaking
    * Choosing a topic to talk about
    * Finding the right conference for your topic
    * Marketing a talk proposal with a convincing abstract
    * Finding open-source presentation software that fits your needs
    * Designing powerful slides

    These tricks will be helpful for experienced presenters looking to learn
    new skills, as well as novice speakers who need some help getting started.

(public speaking with open source tools?)

Who am I?

Why listen to me?

Why would you want to present? 

* fame and glory
* share cool toys
* teaching & giving back
* all of the above

But I can't...

* afford it? pick confs with scholarships or local
* Scared of public speaking? this is how you learn; audiences are supportive
* don't have skills? get into the market of newbietalks; your recent ignorance 
  is an ADVANTAGE

.. note:: 

    but i do'nt know everything! i always have to ask for help! 
    talks are a form of documentation; you're assisting those you asked

Ok but how?

* find a topic
* find a conference
* apply (A LOT)

Slides When?

* Outline as soon as you pick topic -- inspired; you can clean it up later
  (look at *my* git history)
* Try to work on them regularly (habitrpg)
* feature freeze before rehearsing -- artificial deadline; pull your
  all-nighter early
* ignore the people who try to glorify night-before slides; they're just
  jealous

Rehearse

* record yourself. yes you have to. sorry. i know it sucks.

Tools

Traits of slides

* easy to VCS
* sufficient control of appearance (what's 'sufficient' for you?)
* look good when speaking
* iterate fast (not too much boilerplate)
* distribution later (speaker notes or no?)
