Doing the Conferences Thing
===========================

    Have you ever thought about speaking at a conference, then come up with
    some excuse like "I don't know enough", "I'm scared of public speaking",
    or "I don't know where to apply"? Come to this talk to learn how to
    combine the open source tools and technolgies which solve all of those
    problems and more!

    Have you ever wanted to speak at a conference, but not known whether
    you’re good enough or how to start? I was in the same situation 2 years
    ago, but since then I’ve given over a dozen talks at a variety of
    different tech conferences. As well as testing and refining my own
    solutions to the challenges that face new speakers, I’ve learned what
    works and doesn’t work for others.

    This talk will share solutions, often in the form of open-source tools, to
    many of the problems which aspiring speakers encounter, including:

    * Overcoming fear of public speaking
    * Choosing a topic to talk about
    * Finding the right conference for your topic
    * Marketing a talk proposal with a convincing abstract
    * Finding open-source presentation software that fits your needs
    * Designing powerful slides

    These tricks will be helpful for experienced presenters looking to learn
    new skills, as well as novice speakers who need some help getting started.

Me
--

* 5 years at OSU
* LUG, DOBC
* 18 talks, ~3 years

About You
---------

* Who's spoken before but wants to improve?
* Who's never spoken but wants to?
* Never spoken and don't think you want to?

About This
----------

* What I wish someone had told me
* Why we need more talks 
* Logistical details

Talks Matter
============

* Different learning styles
    * Recordings are documentation
* Exposure to new ideas
* Being an Expert

Why do talks from *you* matter?
-------------------------------

* Others benefit: 
    * More perspectives
    * Better tools
* You benefit:
    * Fame & Glory
    * New contributors / feedback
    * Make friends

But I Can't
===========

Can't afford travel?
--------------------

* Local conferences
* Some reimburse

Can't take the time?
--------------------

* Show those constraining you how the conf benefits them
* Find a less abusive job?

Scared of public speaking?
--------------------------

* Audience is on your side
* What's the worst that could happen? (what would you do if you weren't
  afraid?)
* Practice is good
* It gets better

Nothing to talk about?
----------------------

* Pick topic for conf in far future then do a toy project to gain the skill
* Cross-disciplinary talks are sometimes super well recieved
* Write the talk you want to hear
* For newbietalks, recent lack of skills is ADVANTAGEOUS

Ok, but how do I start?
=======================

* Topic
* Conference
* Project
* Slides

Finding Conferences
-------------------

* Call To Speakers
* CFP Wiki
* Technically Speaking list
* Most benefit from attending conferences you enjoy; meet people with similar
  interests (especially those to mentor or be mentored by)

Finding a Topic
---------------

* Own interests
* Recent projects
* Problems you've solved
* Docs that were missing
* "listicle" talks (presented well)
* Examine past successes at this conference

How To Slides
=============

Outline ASAP
------------

* Dump everything you can think of, even the irrelevant stuff, into a document
* Capture inspiration and why you want this talk; it may flee

Maximize content
----------------

* Review frequently (habitrpg)
* Brain-dump important ideas

Organize Sensibly
-----------------

* Core concepts one per index card, munge them around
    * Don't print+rearrange slides; need bigger shuffle
* REPETITION (lack of it was among my biggest noob mistakes)
* When attending talks, pay attention to what you remember from them
* Shortlist of key takeaways should appear at least 3 times

Practice
--------

* First record it by yourself (TOOL: Audacity)
* Then listen (I'm so sorry) and take notes
* Then present it to a friend who's near your target audience
* Then get their feedback (especially on how you fixed what bugged you)
* Then present it to a noob (or someone who can pass as one)
* Get their feedback about what's not explained

Repeat as necessary
-------------------

* Feature freeze slides at T minus 1 week or so (TOOL: calendar with fake
  deadlines, tricks to force you to follow-through... pull allnighter early)
* Rehearse once after feature freeze; TRUST YOUR SLIDES

Slides Technology
=================

Necessary Features
------------------

* Portable (what if your computer dies 5mins before talk?)
* Version-controllable
  * collaborate w/ others
  * reverse history
  * magic backup to reduce impact of deletion
* Presenter console
* Ideally web version + single-file version in sane format (PDF)
* Control image size, location, attribution

.. note:: 

    but i do'nt know everything! i always have to ask for help! 
    talks are a form of documentation; you're assisting those you asked

Ok but how?

* find a topic
* find a conference
* apply (A LOT)

Slides When?

* Outline as soon as you pick topic -- inspired; you can clean it up later
  (look at *my* git history)
* Try to work on them regularly (habitrpg)
* feature freeze before rehearsing -- artificial deadline; pull your
  all-nighter early
* ignore the people who try to glorify night-before slides; they're just
  jealous

Rehearse

* record yourself. yes you have to. sorry. i know it sucks.

Tools

Traits of slides

* easy to VCS
* sufficient control of appearance (what's 'sufficient' for you?)
* look good when speaking
* iterate fast (not too much boilerplate)
* distribution later (speaker notes or no?)

Tech
