Writing your talk
    Gather content
        I <3 notecards
        Lists, digital or physical
        Organization doesn't matter
        Brainstorm!
    Research
        Google
        Interviews (including Twitter/IRC)
        Hands-on trial-and-error
        Add results to your content
    Organize ideas
        Tell a story
        Beginning, middle, end
        Conflict & resolution
        Look up writing/storytelling resources
        How are your favorite talks structured?
        Toss what doesn't fit
    What did your title & abstract promise?
        Answer a question?
        Tell a story?
        People will be in your room because they want that.
    Transitions & Flow
        You will have to talk from one point to another
        Telling a story: Have implicitreason for switching topics
        Outlines often help
    Repeat key points
        Pick your top 3 takeaways
        Make sure each shows up at least 3x through the talk
Making Slides
    Text vs images
        Text: Stand-alone slides, can get boring
        Images: Needs a blog post
        Cite yo' sources!!
        Expect crummy projector
        How do your favorite talks do this? Why do you <3 them?
    Popular tools
        Keynote
        reveal.js
        Beamer

        Don't count on audio
        Check for speeling erors
        Code-Of-Conduct...
    Taunting the Demo-Gods
        Pre-record
        Optionally, make it look real
        Static show-and-tell is fine
    Accessibility!

        Font size?
        Seizures?

        Use your written words (Deaf, ESL)
    Put them online!
        License? (I'm bad at this)
        archive.org
        Put the URL in your slides, or tweet/blog it!

    Plan your timing

        How much time does each section need?
        Will you take questions? During or after?
    Record yourself
        Bad slide/topic transitions will feel terrible
        And then listen
        Take notes on verbal distractions
        Take notes on content flow
        Silence is OK.
    Make Changes
        Speaker notes: Key points, transitions
