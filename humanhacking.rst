Human Hacking
=============

.. note:: 
    Is the project of your dreams ignoring your pull requests? Do you need a way to
    convince other contributors to improve their documentation? Are you trying to herd
    cats as a project leader, or simply wondering how to evaluate a project's culture from
    the outside before getting involved? This talk will explain some basic principles of
    human motivation and behavior and include examples and story time about applying
    them in the world of open­source software. It will provide simple heuristics and
    algorithms for common sources of confusion about human interaction, explained in
    terms that will make sense to engineers.

.. note:: Intro: Writing curricula is hard. trying to jump into a circular
    dependency of knowledge. 
    
    I'm an active open source contributor 

    <gh commit graph screenshot>

    , a leader of things 

    <PHRED, OSURC, LUG, DOBC>

    , and an amateur student of psychology

    <photo of bookshelf>

    , and incidentally and reluctantly still a student at OSU.

Being Scientific
----------------

.. note:: I'll cite sources when I make claims, I've gotten this proofed by
    others whom I sure hope know what they're talking about, but to apply
    these things you have to apply the correct mindset: 

    <dictionary definition of pragmatic>

    Think of the stories in this talk as fairytales or campfire tales; they
    shouldn't be applied directly and literally but instead used as data
    points to help you see what to look for in gathering your own data and
    coming to your own conclusions about the applicability of the principles
    that i'm discussing. 

    Being scientific == the mindset that you have got to ues to get useful
    results from any "experiment" or time you change a cause to see how its
    effects are altered. 

What happened?

Why did it happen?

How will changing the contributing factors change the results?

Getting What You Want
---------------------

.. note::
    I realize my abstract is written in a way that will attract people who
    want to learn how to *get what they want* from open-source humans. 

    my "be careful what you wish for" is as follows: Identify what you want.
    Does it make life better or worse for you and the people around you? If
    it's unprecedented, get others' feedback on whether they'd see its results
    as an improvement. 

    If what you think you want is generally harmful, examine why you want it
    and whether that underlying desire could be satisfied through another
    course of action with fewer detrimental effects. 

    Harming others as collateral damage to selfishness is generally bad for 
    you because most people who intentionally harm others percieve themselves
    as doing it to right some wrong against them. Fewer wrongs against others
    => fewer wronged people thinking it's ok to try to harm you.

    But that caveat is step 1. Step 0 is knowing what you want. If you don't
    konw what you want, I can't help you -- go spin up an instance of Elizabot
    and talk to her or something. What I regard as human hacking is mostly
    about channeling motivations and fulfilling desires, not about summoning
    that motivation out of thin air.

Outline

.. note:: pic of person -> people -> group -> leadership

웃
==

Why do people do things?

.. note:: about models, generalization, only sometimes useful, etc. 

Maslow
------

.. note:: 

    <picture of maslow's hierarchy of needs pyramid>

MBTI types
----------

.. note:: 4 axes, sides of each axis, matrix of types

Disposition Matrix
------------------

.. note:: not the conspiracy theorists' list. Book suggestion.

Priorities
----------

* Fast vs slow gratification
* **personal narrative/monolog**

.. note:: internal monolog goes with Dryack's story about Fred


Fallacies
---------

.. note:: 

    <Wikipedia's list of fallacies>

    Negative connotations but neither necessarily good nor bad, they just
    *explain*. 

    <the xkcd about breaking changes>

    impostor syndrome, dunning-kruger, etc. for tech... several slides
    that thing about asking favors

    <example of same "fallacy" being both good and bad>


A word of warning
-----------------

.. note:: genearlizations are useful because they help you ask the right
    questions and suggest what to look for
    
    Differences != flaws -- a trait that's a strength in one context is a
    weakness in another. 

    Never assume you have enough context -- if you want to say/do something
    that makes an assumption, look for a less assumptive way to phrase it or
    at least acknowledge that guess. Example: initial conversation w/ Dryack

웃웃
====

.. note:: all of the factors that affect an individual's behavior are still
    relevant... 

Social Scripts
--------------

.. note:: 
    Kind of like conversations with NPCs in a video game

    helpful for dealing with anxiety -- get help from a friend who's good at
    handling a given situation to write out its script if you're nervous.
    They'll feel good...

Reciprocity
-----------

.. note:: benjamin franklin quote about getting people to do you favors?

Body Language
-------------

.. note:: dominant/confident/aggressive vs submissive/uncertain/scared

    "Body language" of online communication: 
        * sentence length/structure/punctuation ~= tone
        * word choice ~= style of dress or medium of meatspace comms (graffiti
          vs newsletter vs political speech)
        * presence/absence in IRC channel (rage quit = slamming door)
        * interrupting with offtopic or inane things ~= being fidgety and
          attention-seeking
        * typing super slowly ~= mumble or stutter
        * email address, handle, email sig ~= race, hairstyle, instantly
          obvious things

Mirroring
---------

.. note:: 
    Hints at someone's communication style and priorities -- match their style

    most assume all others think/feel/prioritize the same way they do, until
    they learn otherwise

Inviting conversation
---------------------

.. note:: 
    we'll get into how to get a specific question answered from a project
    later; this is along the lines of generally making friends

    when do *you* feel safe approaching someone and then do it? give the
    situation those traits. 

    * be present, calm, engaged in shared channels
    * subtly solve a problem of theirs

    storytime: trying to talk to linus at linuxcon vs plug

Effective email
---------------

.. note:: 
    again look at your own inbox -- which important messages are still
    unanswered? why? because they're hard

    * use a good title
    * most people only see one ask per message
    * summarize w/ bullet points
    * anticipate questions -- know audience and purpose

Social Capital
--------------

.. note:: 
    karma, esteem, popularity, call it what you will

    DON'T LIE TO SOUND COOL
        * storytime: Google interviews if you rate yourself a 10 at a skill
    
    Making recommendations is a gamble of social capital, proportionate to the
    pain that'll ensue if the recommendation was wrong


Stalking Skills
---------------

.. note::
    GitHub
    IRC
    social media
    news articles
    personal site/blog

================

FOSS
----

.. note::
    Meritocracy: Currency is fucks given measured in lines of code

Getting Taken Seriously
-----------------------

.. note::
    non-ridiculous handle
    conform to channel/list behavior
        storytime: gifs vs no gifs
    ask questions well

Asking Questions Well
---------------------

.. note::
    KNOW WHAT YOU WANT

    I want ____ to ___ in order to ____. At ____, I read that ____ which makes
    me think that I should be able to get it to _____ by doing ______. But
    when I try to ______, ______ happens instead. Please help me ______. 

    * decypher error
    * find an alternative
    * find the correct documentation


Case study: They're ignoring my PRs!
------------------------------------

.. note::
    is your expectation realistic?
    what feedback have you gotten?
    where could you get some feedback?
    what's blocking them? can you help?
    the magic of "when shall I remind you..."

Routes into a project
---------------------

.. note::
    1) use it and fix a bug
    2) find a contributor you know and get mentored/introduced
    3) edunham's help with installdocs technique
    4) start your own project

Improving Docs
--------------

.. note::
    For mega-karma just offer to do it yourself
        * first diagnose why they haven't been written already
            * not needed by target audience?
            * project doesn't care?
            * just not enough time / too much work (usually)?
    are you asking the right person?
    can/should you change project culture? (social influence)
    remove roadblocks (empower)

Route Around Damage
-------------------

.. note::
    yes maybe it takes more effort; this means that you'll only do the things
    that're worth it

    storytime: pessimistic coworker and big new project idea (dobc)

Leveraging Conferences
----------------------

.. note::

    <PICTURE FROM FIRST DAY OF SEAGL>

    hallway track
    when you get a business card, take notes
    FOLLOW-UP sets you apart
    when writing talk proposals, questions show that you know your audience
    stalk conference abstracts from past years to get a feel for tone

Leadership
==========

Know Your Audience
------------------

.. note::
    goals
    priorities
    biases

Establishing Culture
--------------------

.. note::
    accountability -- CONSISTENCY
    benefit of the doubt -- they chose best of percieved options. to change
    future behavior, ADD MORE OPTIONS
    empower...

Delegation
----------

.. note:: 
    successful leadership is when everybody else does the work
    the bus problem (git-bus)
    EMPOWER minions vs DIY... what do you gain by burning yourself out?
    KNOW WHAT YOU WANT
    knowing it will happen == knowing who will do it

Managing Expectations
---------------------

.. note::
    pre-emptive strike with codes of conduct, clear expectations, etc.
    dropped balls are noticed a LOT less than perfect serves
        * good for managing own burnout

pre-emptive problem solving
---------------------------

.. note::
    clearly communicate expectations -- this includes being attentive to what
    the group wants its expectations to be
    
    Establish code of conduct early, enforce consistently
    get buy-in from group, leverage inner monolog (i'm a good contributor) to
    get public commitment to go along with rules once group votes

    don't make enemies; be careful with professional friendships because if
    you need to end them... yeah

    keep all communications on the record and remain beyond reproach

    if possible, don't feed the trolls

DFIU
----

.. note::
    don't leak information or make people feel unsafe -- don't make it worse
    try not to break consistency of rule enforcement -- don't discriminate
    storytime: EMT rules (find the patient, don't kill the patient...)

And Yet...
----------

.. note:: 
    <picture: fire station on fire>

    sometimes you do your best and yet it all goes to shit anyways.

    techniques: get someone who feels offended to propose a rule that could be
    enforced equally on everyone in the channel including them... asking them
    for help/input at least makes them feel included

    mirroring is super powerful for inciting self-awareness of behavior, but
    self-awareness does not necessarily inspire them to change and can in
    cases with self-hatred or w/e actually make things worse

Getting People Out
------------------

.. note::
    assess the situation. what's best for the rest of the group? if someone is
    causing drama for attention, how to avoid giving it to them?

    why aren't they doing something productive/useful with their life? 
        * insufficient information? can they be educated?
        * path of least resistance? increase resistance till they go troll
          someone else
    super important time to step back from perception that you're "right" and
    they're "wrong"

Avoiding Burnout
----------------

.. note:: 
    empower group
    realistic expectations
    forgive yourself

Leadership Handoff
------------------

.. note:: 
    madlibs version of common tasks
    canned responses
    share with newbie during transition
    mentor vs. walk away... 
    diversity: recognize that new leader does not work the same way you do,
    and that's good for the group -- work with them to use your handoff to
    make the next handoff easier

Mental health / brain bugs
--------------------------

.. note::
    read the CVE
    apply patches (usefully obtained from shrinks)
    unplugged machine is "secure" but useless

Sneaky Hacks
------------

.. note:: 
    disregard expectations of fairness
    eliciting information:
        * leverage traits we've talked about, desire to correct falsehoods,
          quid pro quo, etc
    social engineering
    do things that make you happy/motivated/inspired
