Human Hacking
=============

.. note:: 
    Is the project of your dreams ignoring your pull requests? Do you need a way to
    convince other contributors to improve their documentation? Are you trying to herd
    cats as a project leader, or simply wondering how to evaluate a project's culture from
    the outside before getting involved? This talk will explain some basic principles of
    human motivation and behavior and include examples and story time about applying
    them in the world of openÂ­source software. It will provide simple heuristics and
    algorithms for common sources of confusion about human interaction, explained in
    terms that will make sense to engineers.
