Human Hacking
=============

.. note:: 
    Is the project of your dreams ignoring your pull requests? Do you need a way to
    convince other contributors to improve their documentation? Are you trying to herd
    cats as a project leader, or simply wondering how to evaluate a project's culture from
    the outside before getting involved? This talk will explain some basic principles of
    human motivation and behavior and include examples and story time about applying
    them in the world of open­source software. It will provide simple heuristics and
    algorithms for common sources of confusion about human interaction, explained in
    terms that will make sense to engineers.

.. note:: Intro: Writing curricula is hard. trying to jump into a circular
    dependency of knowledge. 
    
    I'm an active open source contributor 

    <gh commit graph screenshot>

    , a leader of things 

    <PHRED, OSURC, LUG, DOBC>

    , and an amateur student of psychology

    , and incidentally and reluctantly still a student at OSU.

Being Scientific
----------------

.. note:: I'll cite sources when I make claims, I've gotten this proofed by
    others whom I sure hope know what they're talking about, but to apply
    these things you have to apply the correct mindset: 

    <dictionary definition of pragmatic>

    Think of the stories in this talk as fairytales or campfire tales; they
    shouldn't be applied directly and literally but instead used as data
    points to help you see what to look for in gathering your own data and
    coming to your own conclusions about the applicability of the principles
    that i'm discussing. 

    Being scientific == the mindset that you have got to ues to get useful
    results from any "experiment" or time you change a cause to see how its
    effects are altered. 

What happened?

Why did it happen?

How will changing the contributing factors change the results?

Getting What You Want
---------------------

.. note::
    I realize my abstract is written in a way that will attract people who
    want to learn how to *get what they want* from open-source humans. 

    my "be careful what you wish for" is as follows: Identify what you want.
    Does it make life better or worse for you and the people around you? If
    it's unprecedented, get others' feedback on whether they'd see its results
    as an improvement. 

    If what you think you want is generally harmful, examine why you want it
    and whether that underlying desire could be satisfied through another
    course of action with fewer detrimental effects. 

    Harming others as collateral damage to selfishness is generally bad for 
    you because most people who intentionally harm others percieve themselves
    as doing it to right some wrong against them. Fewer wrongs against others
    => fewer wronged people thinking it's ok to try to harm you.

Outline

.. note:: pic of person -> people -> group -> leadership

==

Why do people do things?

.. note:: about models, generalization, only sometimes useful, etc. 

Maslow
------

.. note:: 

    <picture of maslow's hierarchy of needs pyramid>

Priorities
----------

* Fast vs slow gratification
* personal narrative/monolog

.. note:: internal monolog goes with Dryack's story about Fred

Fallacies
---------

.. note:: 

    <Wikipedia's list of fallacies>

    Negative connotations but neither necessarily good nor bad, they just
    *explain*. 

    <example of same "fallacy" being both good and bad>

MBTI types
----------

.. note:: 4 axes, sides of each axis, matrix of types

Disposition Matrix
------------------

.. note:: not the conspiracy theorists' list. Book suggestion.

A word of warning
-----------------

.. note:: genearlizations are useful because they help you ask the right
    questions and suggest what to look for
    
    Differences != flaws -- a trait that's a strength in one context is a
    weakness in another. 

    Never assume you have enough context -- if you want to say/do something
    that makes an assumption, look for a less assumptive way to phrase it or
    at least acknowledge that guess. Example: initial conversation w/ Dryack

웃웃
====

.. note:: all of the factors that affect an individual's behavior are still
    relevant... 

Social Scripts
--------------

.. note:: 
    Kind of like conversations with NPCs in a video game

    helpful for dealing with anxiety -- get help from a friend who's good at
    handling a given situation to write out its script if you're nervous.
    They'll feel good...

Reciprocity
-----------

.. note:: benjamin franklin quote about getting people to do you favors?

Body Language
-------------

.. note:: dominant/confident/aggressive vs submissive/uncertain/scared

    "Body language" of online communication: 
        * sentence length/structure/punctuation ~= tone
        * word choice ~= style of dress or medium of meatspace comms (graffiti
          vs newsletter vs political speech)
        * presence/absence in IRC channel (rage quit = slamming door)
        * interrupting with offtopic or inane things ~= being fidgety and
          attention-seeking
        * typing super slowly ~= mumble or stutter
        * email address, handle, email sig ~= race, hairstyle, instantly
          obvious things

Mirroring
---------

.. note:: 
    Hints at someone's communication style and priorities -- match their style

    most assume all others think/feel/prioritize the same way they do, until
    they learn otherwise

Inviting conversation
---------------------

.. note:: 
    we'll get into how to get a specific question answered from a project
    later; this is along the lines of generally making friends

    when do *you* feel safe approaching someone and then do it? give the
    situation those traits. 

    * be present, calm, engaged in shared channels
    * subtly solve a problem of theirs

    storytime: trying to talk to linus at linuxcon vs plug

Effective email
---------------

.. note:: 
    again look at your own inbox -- which important messages are still
    unanswered? why? because they're hard

    * use a good title
    * most people only see one ask per message
    * summarize w/ bullet points
    * anticipate questions -- know audience and purpose

Social Capital
--------------

.. note:: 
    karma, esteem, popularity, call it what you will

    DON'T LIE TO SOUND COOL
        * storytime: Google interviews if you rate yourself a 10 at a skill
    
    Making recommendations is a gamble of social capital, proportionate to the
    pain that'll ensue if the recommendation was wrong
