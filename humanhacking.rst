Human Hacking
=============

.. note:: 
    Is the project of your dreams ignoring your pull requests? Do you need a way to
    convince other contributors to improve their documentation? Are you trying to herd
    cats as a project leader, or simply wondering how to evaluate a project's culture from
    the outside before getting involved? This talk will explain some basic principles of
    human motivation and behavior and include examples and story time about applying
    them in the world of open­source software. It will provide simple heuristics and
    algorithms for common sources of confusion about human interaction, explained in
    terms that will make sense to engineers.

.. note:: Intro: Writing curricula is hard. trying to jump into a circular
    dependency of knowledge. 
    
    I'm an active open source contributor 

    <gh commit graph screenshot>

    , a leader of things 

    <PHRED, OSURC, LUG, DOBC>

    , and an amateur student of psychology

    , and incidentally and reluctantly still a student at OSU.

Being Scientific
----------------

.. note:: I'll cite sources when I make claims, I've gotten this proofed by
    others whom I sure hope know what they're talking about, but to apply
    these things you have to apply the correct mindset: 

    <dictionary definition of pragmatic>

    Think of the stories in this talk as fairytales or campfire tales; they
    shouldn't be applied directly and literally but instead used as data
    points to help you see what to look for in gathering your own data and
    coming to your own conclusions about the applicability of the principles
    that i'm discussing. 

    Being scientific == the mindset that you have got to ues to get useful
    results from any "experiment" or time you change a cause to see how its
    effects are altered. 

What happened?

Why did it happen?

How will changing the contributing factors change the results?

Outline

Why do people do things?

.. note:: about models, generalization, only sometimes useful, etc. 

Maslow
------

.. note:: 

    <picture of maslow's hierarchy of needs pyramid>

Priorities
----------

* Fast vs slow gratification
* personal narrative/monolog

.. note:: internal monolog goes with Dryack's story about Fred

Fallacies
---------

.. note:: 

    <Wikipedia's list of fallacies>

    Negative connotations but neither necessarily good nor bad, they just
    *explain*. 

    <example of same "fallacy" being both good and bad>
