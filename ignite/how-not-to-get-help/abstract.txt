Part 1 of "how to have a miserable time in open source" will teach the
techniques which leave bugs unfixed and questions unanswered.

How to avoid getting answers on IRC:

* Ask in a channel where nobody knows the answer, or where your question is
  offtopic.
        CAUTION: If you ask in a relevant channel, it's likely that an expert
        will here your complaints and suggest a solution!
* Quit the channel immediately after asking
        CAUTION: If you wait around for a couple hours, or use a persistent
        client, someone might come along and help you out!
* Scare people
    * Vague call for experts
        CAUTION: If you specify what your problem is, people will ask you for
        details and then suggest solutions!
    * Argumentative nickname
        CAUTION: If you pick an unermarkable or even friendly nickname, people
        will think you want to have an ordinary discussion with them!
* Withhold information (if they know what's wrong, they might fix it!)
        CAUTION: If you tell people what error you got or what you were trying
        to do, they might recognize it from their own experiences and suggest
        a solution!

How to avoid getting help online:

* Don't tell anyone that anything is frustrating; just silently leave. They'll
  never know.
* Ask somewhere the experts won't see it. Is the whole community on
  stackoverflow? Go ask in a comment on a YouTube video!
* Make personal attacks against the language or people who use it.

How to make sure a bug never gets fixed:

* Don't file it!
* File it in a place unlrelated to your setup. Address issues to your hosting
  provider, their hosting provider, even the IRC network ops where they host
  their channel!
* Avoid including the information that would be required to reproduce the bug
* Don't answer any requests for more information

How to avoid getting help at a conference or meetup:

* Don't even go!
* Don't talk to anybody. Convince yourself that you're too cool, or not cool
  enough, to mingle with this crowd.
