<slidE: "how to get help>

There's a lot of great information out there about getting started in open
source. You can find plenty of blogs, wikis, and articles detailing the steps
to take to have a fun, successful time.


<slide: how NOT to get help>
But what if you *don't* want to get help? I'm here to fill an unmet need for
advice on what behaviors will practically guarantee that you get to struggle
with your open source problems all by yourself instead of quickly overcoming
them.

Now, internet relay chat or IRC is a dangerous place. It's just full of
experts, willing to offer their advice on overcoming problems. The best way to
keep from getting help on IRC is to never join it at all.

<IRC: Ask in wrong channel>

If you just can't resist the temptation to connect, a good way to keep from
getting useful answers to your question is to ask in a channel unrelated to
the problem at hand. Having an issue with Ruby? You probably won't get a
helpful answer from the Python folks!

<IRC: Solicit expertise>

Now, the next level of challenge in the game of not getting useful help is to
ask in a relevant channel for the project. On-topic channels are where most of
the useful answers come from, after all! So if you're asking in an on-topic
channel, one way to avoid getting an answer is to scare people away with a
vague request for experts. "I get an error when I try to compile the kernel"
is much more likely to solicit state
