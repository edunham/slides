You Will Get Caught

Hey you. Yes, I'm talking to you. Nobody else notices that you're faking it,
and when you try to tell them they picked the wrong person for your job, they
say a bunch of nice things that you're sure are only to make you feel better
and get back to work. 

It's all een a hilarious comedy of errors so far, and somehow nobody has
realized that you have no clue what you're doing. But you don't know how long
it'll continue. 

I was in the same place for a bit. My productivity was kinda shitty; because
I'm lucky enough to work on a totally open project, every task I'd consider at
work would be a huge opportunity to get caught. So I didn't take on nearly as
much as everybody around me said I was capable of. 

But then this thing happened. Part of what I think makes me so unqualified for
my role is the way I'm kinda bad at saying no -- I go about under the
impression that if I admit I can't do something or give a time estimate that's
too long, everybody will realize and fire me. And getting fired would be
massively inconvenient, though there's times when I wonder if it'd be better
for the team. 

So here's how it got me. 

* took on a project that I thought should've been easy
* nearly had it, which confirms it should be easy, and then scope crept in a
  way that broke my algorithm
* this should be easy, so failure is scary
* boss calls a meeting w/ him and a senior team member
* oh shit i'm getting fired
* at this point the code is like 6 months overdue and idk how to fix it and
  idk how to ask for help
* we talk about it and boss says he feels responsible for not mentoring better
* says it's like what he ran into in grad school
* figure out plan for offloading it onto another team member who's better
  qualified then developing my coding skills
* holy shit i'm not fired
