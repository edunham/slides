Hi! I’m Emily Dunham, and I’m here to talk about those pieces of paper you
have to submit when you’re following up with a company who’s hiring.

My current job, which I <3, is infra for Rust+Servo.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My resume is a piece of code that helped me find a role I love.

We’re fortunate to work in a field that often has more jobs than qualified
candidates to fill them, but who here has ever had a DevOps role that you
disliked?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you find yourself in a job you’d rather get out of, the best solution is
to ask your friends who’s hiring, but sometimes you just have to throw a
resume into a pile.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Who here hates having to update your resume?

A one-off document that’s rarely useful is like an unmaintained server or code
base – but fortunately, we know some things about fixing that!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So to talk about DevOpsing your Resume, we should start with defining what
DevOps actually means.

On the technical side, DevOps is about automation. DevOps emerged as we
started to build and reuse tools that make life easier.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Socially, DevOps is about charging past the sometimes-crippling bureacracy of
silos to work with whoever you need to and get stuff done.

What’s this got to do with your resume?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first goal of treating your resume as code is to let you use the same
tools that help you maintain code quality.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

But a resume isn’t judged on the same metrics as code. Readability and content
matter, but the aesthetics of its typesetting also contribute to the first
impression that it makes on your behalf.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My favorite tool for treating a resume as a single code file is LaTeX. You
control everything about the typesetting, and can write macros to ensure style
consistency between sections.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once your resume is a text file that you can compile into a beautifully
typeset PDF, you can use your favorite version control tooling to manage its
source!

Use separate branches to track the variants of your resume that correspond to
different hats you wear, or emphasize certain skills.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As well as letting you develop features in parallel with each other, version
control is a time travel technology.

Want to know what your resume looked like on a certain date, or undo removing
a section?

Just `git checkout` the right commit!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When your resume is a file of code that’s kept in version control, you can
think about testing it.

You can automatically spell check every change, or verify that it still
renders without errors into a single page.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And once you’re automatically catching obvious errors like spelling issues,
the tools you already use to get feedback on your code can accelerate the
process of having a peer or mentor review changes to your resume’s content!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You should use whatever tools you’re comfortable with, but I’d suggest
preferring Free/Libre technologies for a long-lived project like your resume.

Otherwise, you’re in for a lot of work if a vendor discontinues their
proprietary offering!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That’s how to DevOps your resume, but what do you put in it?

One of a DevOp’s most important tasks is to identify their projects’ end users
and communicate with them about what they need.

You can use this skill to make your resume more useful to its readers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Consider that your resume’s readers will often be pressed for time.

Meet their needs by prioritizing the most relevant content, keeping sentences
short or replacing them entirely with bulleted lists, and only including
information that tells them something they need to know about you.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scrutinize your resume from its reader’s perspective and see what kind of
prospective colleague it makes you look like.

And if you have too much content, remove any technology that it would make you
sad to work with every day.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you’ve put all this work into developing your resume’s content, the last
step is to recycle it!

 Fill out a LinkedIn profile if you like getting contacted by recruiters, and
use your resume’s content to keep the “about me” page of your personal web
site up to date.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Maintaining your resume like any other piece of code can help it benefit from
the very skills that it showcases.

Your reward for investing care and attention in this process is a resume
that’s ready when you need it, instead of an out-of-date document whose
mountain of overdue updates deter you from pursuing great career
opportunities.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

But remember, talking to other humans is still the best way to make sure
you’re applying for a role that’ll meet your goals.

When you tell people that you’re job hunting, let them know what you’ve loved
about your best jobs and hated about your worst.
