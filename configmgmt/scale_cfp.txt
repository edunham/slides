Audience: Beginner

Topic: DevOps

Tags: puppet, chef, saltstack, ansible, infrastructure as code, devops

Brief description: The basic principles of config management and how they're
expressed by Puppet, Chef, SaltStack, and Ansible. 

Short abstract: Do you manage several servers and wish you could keep track of
who made what change, when? Would you like to simplify the process of setting
up a new machine? Have you worked with one configuration management tool and
wondered how it compares to others? 

This talk will cover the basic principles of and challenges faced by
configuration management, with examples from several widespread and growing
open source configuration management tools.

Message to reviewers: I've worked with Chef and Puppet at the OSU Open Source
Lab, Chef at Urban Airship, and SaltStack and Ansible as the lead DevOps
engineer for Mozilla Research. 

I've written up some similar work to this talk earlier this year at
http://edunham.net/2015/06/05/configuration_management_comparison.html , and
since that post I've refined my understanding of both Salt and Ansible
significantly.
