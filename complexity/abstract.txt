LinuxFest Northwest 2015
========================

When you're new to programming, or self-taught with an emphasis on those
topics that're directly relevant to your current project, it's easy to skip
learning about analyzing the complexity of algorithms. 

But when your pet project runs too slowly, you find yourself wondering if there's
anything you can do to speed it up. This talk will minimize the scary math
which often accompanies formal computer science education, while maximizing
concrete examples of what the mysterious greek letters mean and how
understanding them can help you. It will also include an overview of the
profiling tools which professionals use to analyze real code and understand
its performance problems.
