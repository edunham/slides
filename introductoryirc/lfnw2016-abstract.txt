Despite the recent popularity of proprietary communication platforms, internet
relay chat is still the main gathering place for open source communities. If
you've never been on IRC before or are confused by the many networks,
channels, and clients available, this talk is for you!

We'll discuss what IRC is, how to choose and install the software you'll use
to access it, how to find the right channel for your needs, and the cultural
knowledge you'll need to get your questions answered once you're there.
