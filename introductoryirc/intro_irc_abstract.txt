Introduction to IRC

Internet Relay Chat is a favorite communication tool among open source users
and developers. If you've never been on IRC before or are confused by the many
networks, channels, and clients available, this talk will help you understand
and get involved with IRC communities. We'll discuss the differences between
servers, networks, and channels, with a focus on how to find the communities
that best fit your interests.   After explaining what IRC is, the talk will
help you choose which client software best fits your needs. You'll learn about
the unique benefits and challenges of the type of communication that IRC
encourages, and the etiquette of being a good community member in IRC
channels.
