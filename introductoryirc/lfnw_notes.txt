If you've never been on IRC before or are confused by the many networks,
channels, and clients available, this talk is for you!

* What IRC is
    * Internet Relay Chat
    * More real-time than emails; less synchronous than voice (DRAW THE SPECTRUM)
    * Networks, channels, PMs
    * Social functions:
        * Gathering place
        * Water cooler
        * See & be seen
        * Informal chat channels to build friendships by finding shared experiences
        * Professional networking, show off problemsolving and communication skills
        * Establish social hierarchy within project, demonstrate judgement + knowledge
    * Open protocol
    * https://xkcd.com/1357/

* How to access it (Linux/Windows/Mac)

    * GUI vs terminal
    * Local options

* Choosing a nickname

Naming things is hard. You should probably pick a name and stick to it
throughout your involvement, because it will cause others to recognize the
time you've invested. Plus, community trust requires a certain critical mass
of being involved without being a jerk.

If you're doing this semi-professionally or want to include it on your resume,
it's boring but safe to throw together a mashup of your "real" name or
initials. Ideally you should find something that's available as a github
handle and as a twitter handle and as a url (bonus points for having the last
few characters be a TLD that you can register it under), but that's optional.
A nick available on Freenode will usually be available on smaller networks as
well.

Nonsensical but pronounceable nicks are ok too (nobody's sure where ms2ger got
his, but it's memorable, available, and not offensive)

Steer clear of culturally provocative (seahawksfan, therepublican). Flaunting
traits irrelevant to your technical skills will make others think you think
they're relevant and invite criticism; "PhysicallyAdvangagedGentleman" or
"NerdiestGirlEver" aren't great.

Uniqueness: Try not to have mroe than 4 characters in common with the start of
a community leader's nick. Tab completion.

* How to find the right channel
* Cultural knowledge for getting answers

* Third person singular "they" IS OKAY

* Major Don'ts:
    * Impatience. It's kinda asynchronous, and everyone is volunteers.
      Nobody's obligated to help you improve your question if you ask it
      poorly.
    * Assumptions. Channel ops aren't necessarily project leads. IRC tells you
      nothing about someone's...
        * age
        * wealth or lack thereof
        * location
        * time zone / subjective time of day (not necessarily as tied to
          location as you'd hope)
        * Gender, appearance, preferred pronouns (it's ok to say 'they')
        * Mental health conditions or lack thereof
        * Religious or political affiliations

    * Exercise for handling assumptions: Picture the person in your head.
      Would you say the thing you're about to if all those assumptions were
      wrong? ie in #linuxchix I expect that I'm speaking with someone age 20-60,
      probably female, probably from the US or India, probably involved in a tech
      career. But I shouldn't say anything that would offend someone male, 12 or 80
      from Russia or Brazil who works as a pilot or doctor or waiter.

    * Flooding. Gotta paste something? Use a pastebin. Beware of PuTTY for it
      pastes on right-click.

    * Exercise to prevent flooding: Join into an empty channel
      (#edunhams-test-channel or w/e your nick is) and try to paste 20 lines.
      See if your client stops you. Learn how to make it stop you, then test
      again.

    * Don't lie in your nick. ceo_of_google might technically be available,
      but it will not make any positive impressions on anyone.
