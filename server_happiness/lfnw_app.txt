The Meme of Best Practices


In its original meaning, a "meme" is "an element of a culture or system of
behaviour passed from one individual to another by imitation or other
non-genetic means.", though online it's taken on a much broader definition.
Similarly, the term "DevOps" is rapidly expanding to encompass everyone who
runs a server and wants to automate themself out a job. And yet, no institute
of higher education offers a formal curriculum for DevOps!

Founding one of the world's first university-level DevOps training programs
caused the presenter to examine how DevOps engineers have traditionally been
trained. Although systems administration and DevOps are historically
apprenticeship-based and often self-taught out of necessity, the internet
facilitiates  distributed mentorship in the form of anecdotes, popular images,
and sometimes captioned cats.

This talk will explore the engineering best practices and warnings with which
DevOps engineers mentor their colleagues, even when everyone involved thinks
they're just goofing off. 


Speaking Experience:

I've given 21 talks at various events over the past 3 years, listed at
http://edunham.net/pages/talks.html with their slides and recordings. 

I'd recommend the slide deck
http://talks.edunham.net/linuxfestnorthwest2015/git/#1 for a look into how I
teach technical concepts, and the recording at
https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=LPqqoOm8y5s#t=1381
for 5 minutes of me engaging with an audience.
