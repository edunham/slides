Title: Where's The Cloud?
Topic: UpSCALE
Tags: cloud, devops, aws
Brief description: Congratulations, your server is "in the cloud"! Let's look
at where it actually went.

Short Abstract: You've already heard the news: "There is no cloud, only
somebody else's computer". But whose computer is it? Where? How did your data
or VM get there? And the scary part; Which components of this glorious Rube
Goldberg machine can malfunction in a way that destroys your uptime or your
imaginary server forever? 

Long Abstract: Maps of the the internet's core infrastructure are cool. Maps of
where major cloud hosting providers' datacenters live are also cool,
especially when combined with an explanation of why they're there! Prepare to
leave this talk feeling even less confident in the stability of the Internet
than you did at the beginning.
